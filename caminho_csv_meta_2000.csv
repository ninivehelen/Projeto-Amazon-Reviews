To the east it disappeared into the flat treeless horizon of the estuary, merging into the earth just as the earth merged into the sea at the muddy edge of England. As it left London, this road, which in only a few years would become a highway, formed the northern boundary of a dreary region of swampy land. The great river, as it bent south then north again, formed the southern edge of this semicircle of marshland. It had been drained and flooded, drained and flooded half a dozen times in the previous fifty years, while England burned Protestants then Catholics and then Protestants again. This place could not seem to decide if it was of the river or of the earth. The ancient name for the misbegotten half-land was Wapping. No one could remember where the name came from. In recent years small wharves and little clusters of houses had appeared along the riverbank at Wapping. The rich men who funded the buildings decided that houses and wharves would do a better job of keeping out the river than the sea walls they’d been building for decades in their vain attempts to reclaim the land from the waters. And, more to the point, a wharf generated more profit than a wall. During the days men made themselves busy around the dozens of boats that moored up along the wharves, the vessels settling down into the riverbed when the tide went out and rising again as it flooded back in, washing up against the wood-and-brick pilings. The pickings were not rich. London’s most lucrative trade still headed further upstream toward the wharves that operated within the city walls, but a new gray economy was emerging here downstream at Wapping. Beyond this sliver of moneymaking and building, back behind the wharves, between the river and the road, were the marshes. The occasional flood still occurred, sweeping away families and livelihoods as well as the property of the men of business. This dank, oozing landscape, unpromising and undeveloped, was the result of the river’s inundations. The ground was low, lower than sea level in some places, rising up to the bluff along which the road ran to the north. A man could stand there in the marshes, his feet sinking into the mud, and look to the backs of the wharves and warehouses along the river and imagine that they were floating on water. There was a gap in the riverside development, and in this gap stood a group of gallows. The gallows lived on borrowed time—already there were complaints that this place of execution was dragging down the land value of investments. Could it not be moved downstream a bit, perhaps to Ratcliffe, somewhere benighted and undeveloped where men of business were not trying to attract custom? But for now the gallows still stood. On this midsummer’s eve there were six river pirates hanging there. The gallows were right at the water’s edge, set in among the wharves. The six unfortunates hanging from the ropes had been caught after leaping aboard a barge in the river. It had been their sixth attack in four weeks and it was to be their last. The local lightermen and watermen had banded together to bait a trap for them, putting out stories that a barge with wool intended for France and Spain would be traveling downstream that day. When the pirates had clambered onboard, a group of twenty river men hidden beneath sails had emerged and captured them, but sadly not before the pirates, or at least, reported most of the ambushers, the apparent captain of the pirates, whose knife had flashed more quickly and more viciously than those of his crew, had sent three of the Wapping lightermen into the embrace of the old river, their throats slashed and their eyes empty. Eventually the men overcame the pirates and after some cursory discussions with what passed for the authorities in this new outpost they decided upon a customary punishment. The pirates were hanged at Execution Dock, where they would be left for three tides as a signal to others (and perhaps an offering to the river) before being cut down and disposed of. The river was already rising for the first of these three tides when the leader of the pirates heard a clatter of hoofs on the mixture of mud and stones that constituted the main street here in Wapping, running along the curve of the river behind the wharves. A mighty carriage, it sounded like. The clatter stopped, and he heard the sound of a carriage door slamming. A few minutes later, some squelching footsteps as a man approached. The pirate kept his eyes prudently closed as the footsteps stopped, perhaps directly in front of him. Within two hours, the river would be up to the chins of the men on the gallows, before falling back again. Carefully, the pirate opened one eye halfway. He saw the swaying feet of his dead shipmates on either side of him, and opened the eye a little further. His visitor was standing on the foreshore, dressed in the Dutch style, all somber black and white, the clothes effortlessly wealthier than the new gay and gaudy fashions that were rippling out from the English Queen’s court. The visitor cleared his throat and spat. The pirate heard a small splash in the water, and his careful eyes caught the sun as it glittered on a thick lump of green phlegm which appeared and spun around in the water as it commenced its journey down to Tilbury. The visitor glanced up and behind at the gallows, and the pirate closed his eyes quickly. He resolved to keep his eyes that way as the visitor started to speak, in rich aristocratic tones with just the hint of a clammy Dutch accent. “Quite a view they’ve given you. Desirable waterfront property, I’d say.” The pirate said nothing, obviously. The creaking of the gallows was the only sound as he and his men swung gently in the soft summer breeze. Miles and miles upstream, it was a beautiful evening among the willow trees and reeds at Runny\xadmede and Richmond, where the aristocrats played at court and love and wrote poetry to each other. The sun was setting in the opulent west. But here, to the east of the metropolis, the dominant colors were grays and browns. Mud and water, not trees and flowers. The thought seemed to make the visitor positively cheerful. He put his hands behind his back and actually rose up on his toes at the vista before him. “Someday all this will be very desirable property, captain. When my father built his wall here, he had a vision of a new suburb, with the river kept out and the land turned into meadows and orchards. He wanted this to be the prettiest part of London. And all within sight of that dreadful Tower.” It occurred to the pirate to wonder why the Dutchman was speaking when, as far as the man knew, there was no one there alive to listen to him. The visitor spoke again, and even with his eyes closed the pirate captain had the impression that the Dutchman had turned his back on the river and was facing him. Almost as if he were speaking to him. Perhaps he was practicing an address. “You’ll be the last, captain. The last crew to be hanged on this so-called Execution Dock. It’s keeping the developers away, this grisly habit, and this land is valuable. A hundred years, maybe two hundred, this’ll be the busiest port in the world. Trade is coming, captain. Trade. Not petty thievery or the ridiculous swapping of bits of unmade cloth for bits of food ’n’ drink. The world’s wealth is out there waiting to be bought and sold, and unlike most of my countrymen I predict that the buying and selling will happen here, in London, not in Antwerp or Rotterdam. Wapping’s going to flourish. It’s going to become the hub on which the world turns. You’ll go down in history, captain. The last pirate to be hanged at Wapping. My congratulations.” Another movement, and then the sound of the visitor walking back to his carriage. The slamming door, the “hai!” of the coachman, and the snap of hoofs and wheels on the road back into London. And then only the sound of the creaking gallows again. The tide rose, and later it fell. It rose and it fell three times. When the locals came to cut them down, they were disconcerted to find only five pirates hanging from the gallows. The sixth—the captain—had gone.

A Most Dangerous Book: Tacitus's Germania from the Roman Empire to the Third Reich;"['From Publishers Weekly', ""Harvard classics professor Krebs writes a scholarly but lucid account of the abuse of history. Written in 98 C.E. by the Roman official Tacitus, About the Origin and Mores of the Germanic Peoples was lost for centuries but resurfaced around 1500 as Germans were growing resentful of foreign domination—in this case from the Catholic Church in Rome. The rediscovered book launched a primitivist myth that captivated admirers over the next 500 years, from Martin Luther to Heinrich Himmler, who loved its portrayal of ancient Germans as freedom-loving warriors, uncultured but honorable, in contrast to decadent Romans. In fact, Tacitus probably never visited Germany, Krebs notes. Rather, using books and travelers' reports, he wrote for a Roman audience who shared his romantic view of northern barbarians. Enthusiastic German readers, culminating in the Nazis, ignored Tacitus's disparaging comments, misread passages to confirm their prejudices, and proclaimed that the ancient historian confirmed their national superiority. This is an inventive analysis of, and warning against, an irresistible human yearning to find written proof of one's ideology. Illus. (May) (c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

An unlikely friendship ignites between the two, and, in sharing their differences, both of their lives are transformed. Jacqueline Woodson won a Coretta Scott King Honor for this moving, tightly written tale of friendship, racism, and loss. In a starred review,', 'The Horn Book', 'calls it a ""haunting and beautifully poetic novel.""', 'From the Inside Flap', ""old Marie is a leader among the popular black girls in Chauncey, Ohio, a prosperous black suburb. She isn't looking for a friend when Lena Bright, a white girl, appears in school. Yet they are drawn to each other because both have lost their mothers. And they know how to keep a secret. For Lena has a secret that is terrifying, and she's desperate to protect herself and her younger sister from their father. Marie must decide whether she can help Lena by keeping her secret...or by telling it."", 'About the Author', 'Born February 12 in Columbus, Ohio, Jacqueline Woodson grew up in Greenville, South Carolina and Brooklyn, New York and graduated from college with a B.A. in English. A former drama therapist for runaways and homeless children in New York City, she now writes full-time and has received The Kenyon Review Award for Literary Excellence in Fiction. Though she spends most of her time writing, Woodson also enjoys reading the works of emerging writers, encouraging young people to write, heated political conversation with her friends, and sewing. At one time, she made most of her own clothing, but now she makes mostly scarves and quilts for her friends.Jacqueline Woodson began to consider becoming a writer when she was chosen to be the literary editor of a magazine in the fifth grade. Eventually, three books helped convince her to pursue a writing career:', 'The Bluest Eye', 'by Toni Morrison,', 'Daddy Was a Numbers-Runner', 'by Louise Meriwether, and', 'Ruby', 'by Rosa Guy. Before reading those books, Woodson thought that only books featuring mainstream, white characters or works by William Shakespeare constituted valid literature. But in those three books, Woodson saw parts of herself and her life, and realized that books could be about people like her; and she knew she wanted to write them.Now a critically acclaimed author, Woodson writes about characters from a variety of races, ethnic groups, and social classes. Woodson says, ""There are all kinds of people in the world, and I want to help introduce readers to the kinds of people they might not otherwise meet."" Woodson\'s books also feature strong female characters. Some are based on her friends, who she says are ""really amazing people who constantly challenge themselves to make a difference in the world."" Woodson often writes about friendship between girls, as she did in her trilogy about Maizon, and', ""I Hadn't Meant to Tell You This"", '. ""Girls rarely get discussed in books and films,"" she says, ""and I want to do \'girl stories\' that show strong, independent people.

I want to show young people that there are other ways to be.""', 'The House You Pass on the Way', 'is a moving story of growing up different.

Redhook: A Microbrew Success Story;"['From Kirkus Reviews', ""A diverting history of the makers of Redhookmerry pranksters of the brewing businessmildly tainted by Seattleite Krebs's idolatrous tone. From a tumbledown converted transmission shop in Ballard, Wash., came Redhook Ale, an offbeat craft beer that was to the brewing business what Starbucks was to coffee: a blast of fresh air, loaded with character and flavor. And little wonder, as both were the brainchild of Gordon Bowkerin Redhook's case, along with Paul Shipman and the whole brew house cast. Red hook cultivated an eccentric image as the maker of an eccentric product, an ale that reviewers at first described as tasting ``like bananas.'' The wild northwest yeast gave it distinction, claimed Redhooks makers; it was the Belgian style they were really after, they claimed. Actually, the yeast was contaminated, but by then they had a following, so why announce their continuous tinkering? Still, tinker they did, finally getting the yeast right with a chemists help, and also going public, the first microb rewer to do so, with a stock offering that shot skyward. The microbrew market has since bottomed out, and Redhook's bohemian image has been tarnished by expansion that robbed it of its handcrafted cachet. Krebs complements the Redhook story with lots of e ntertaining craft brew tidbits (what puts the steam in Anchor, when is a bottom-fermenting beer an ale), but he also creates a godlike aura around both Bowker and Shipman, as if no one else ever had a good idea when it came to fashioning authentic local p roducts that educated the American palate. The early years make the story herea time when food and drink were in as much ferment as Redhook's bitterand Krebs does tell the story with flair.

The Knowledge-Value Revolution or a History of the Future;"['From Library Journal', 'Soar with Sakaiya on a dizzying journey with this prophetic view of the future. His latest work (he has written 30 books) has already sold over 500,000 copies in Japan and should be successful in this English edition. Sakaiya easily transcends other works in this genre, such as Alvin Toffler\'s The Third Wave ( LJ 4/1/80) or Daniel Bell\'s The Coming of Post-Industrial Society ( LJ 7/73), as he describes a future knowledge-value society. Knowledge-value is ""the price of and the value created by wisdom, and the worth, or price a society gives to that wisdom."" Massive changes will characterize this brave new world, and Sakaiya describes the three main ""disrupters"" as technological advances, population shifts, and dwindling resources. His review of history and broad-brushed approach without footnotes may frustrate some. This is sure to be in demand by CEOs and futurist thinkers and is strongly recommended for most libraries.', '- Dale Farris, Groves, Tex.', 'Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.', 'From Kirkus Reviews', ""Millennial murk that, under the title Chika Kakumei, was a 1985 best-seller in Japan. A former official at his homeland's redoubtable Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Sakaiya prophesies a brave new postindustrial world in which leisure time and wisdom abound but material as well as human resources are in short supply. In the Arcadian environment he envisions, the mass-produced manufactures that underpin modern consumer societies will yield to goods that somehow combine utility with the equivalent of intelligence and distinctively personal appeal. Unfortunately, the author is decidedly vague as to what constitutes a so-called knowledge-value product, making it almost impossible to gain more than an impression of what the near- and longer-term future might hold--if his predictions come true. Paradoxically, perhaps, Sakaiya's projections are based on notably specific conclusions drawn from selective surveys of Middle Eastern, Oriental, and Western civilizations. The author espouses cyclical theory to the extent that he dwells on instances from the past illustrating how conspicuous consumption gave way to thrift, and materialism to spiritual values. In like vein, Sakaiya makes a persuasive case for the proposition that art and fashion are harbingers of marketplace trends. Of particular interest to US readers who bear with the author's discontinuous critique is his conviction that America's open society is better equipped than that of conformist Japan to capitalize on New Age economics. Be that as it may, Sakaiya's musings are too mystical and mystifying to provide a decent return on any time invested trying to make sense of them. --"", 'Copyright ©1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The first twopresenting Castro with a toxic wetsuit and supplying his mistress with poison pills (both were actually attempted)fail. The third, providing a disillusioned Castro protege with a rifle (also a real CIA plan) looks the most promising. Oakes is sent to Cuba to help coordinate the uprising that will inevitably follow.

From the Earth to the Moon by Jules Verne, Fiction, Fantasy & Magic;"['About the Author', ""Jules Gabriel Verne (1828 - 1905) was a French novelist, poet and playwright best known for his adventure novels and his profound influence on the literary genre of science fiction.

His collaboration with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel led to the creation of the Voyages extraordinaires, a widely popular series of scrupulously researched adventure novels including Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864), Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1870), and Around the World in Eighty Days (1873).""]";7.36;Jules Verne (Author);"['Books', ""Children's Books"", 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']";{'Publisher': 'Aegypan (October 1, 2006)', 'Language': 'English', 'Paperback': '136 pages', 'ISBN 10': '1598184547', 'ISBN 13': '978-1598184549', 'Grade level': '4 - 6', 'Item Weight': '7.4 ounces', 'Dimensions': '6 x 0.32 x 9 inches'};1598184547

The CEO of the Sofa;"['From Publishers Weekly', 'Not content to rest on his laurels, the bestselling humorist O\'Rourke (All the Trouble in the World, etc.) instead settles back on his caustic couch to offer a wide-angled worldview from his own living room, his salon of sarcasm. He introduces readers to his assistant, friends, family and smart-aleck babysitter, as he reflects on such topics as cell phones (""People are willing to interrupt anything, including hiding under the bed, to answer a cell phone""), Christmas catalogues, Instant Messaging, MP3s, Nasdaq, toddlers, TV and how the ""Gettysburg Address"" would have turned out if written on an iMac. On a serious note, he praises the ""philosophical legerdemain"" of Hunter Thompson\'s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. He also reviews the ""profound cogitations"" of Hillary Clinton\'s 1995 It Takes a Village (""Some kinds of stupidity cannot be faked""), compares Vegas\'s Venetian resort to the real Venice (""Will video poker ever inspire a novella by Thomas Mann?"") and contemplates the results of bias-free language (""What a piece of work is person!""). For ""senior-management types,"" one hilarious chapter explains youth culture and current celebs, including Moby, Eminem, Carson Daly, Hilary Swank and Beck: ""Beck dropped out of school after junior high so we can\'t blame the dot-com mess on him personally."" Though his vitriolic wit is couched in humor that elicits the gamut from giggles to guffaws, O\'Rourke never cushions its impact. The comedic crescendo is his centerpiece, a summary of mankind\'s achievements at millennium\'s end. This insightful (yet also funny) essay alone is worth the price of admission. (Sept.)Forecast: The 150,000 first printing is backed up with an appealing cover photo, a $150,000 promotional budget, a national ad campaign, an 18-city author tour plus online promotion. O\'Rourke will undoubtedly find himself on the bestseller list again.', 'Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.', 'From Library Journal', ""O'Rourke (Eat the Rich) has come to the fore in the current school of New Journalism that put Hunter Thompson and Tom Wolfe on the literati map. Like or dislike him, one must admit that he has the power to draw the reader into his psychological inferno. His new book crackles with indignation, a lot of it centered on Democrats, liberals, and the Clintons, about whom he writes with such an infusion of malice that it amounts at times almost to rage. In addition to incinerating these evil specimens of humanity, he also does some tub-thumping on such topics as parenting children, wine tasting, Earth Day, and India. The book will prove abundantly entertaining to those who enjoy O'Rourke's attack-dog style of writing and share his views, but it will surely derange the digestion of all others. Unless something cataclysmic happens, the book is likely to find its way to best-sellerdom."", '- A. J.

(He and Christopher Buckley also conduct a most peculiar wine tasting.) For the most part, however, these are O\'Rourke\'s musings on the New Economy, parenthood, ""bias-free writing,"" the presidential election, toddlers, the twentieth century, celebrities, and driving. O\'Rourke takes the potshots his readers will expect at liberals and Democrats in general and such usual suspects as Gore, Daschle, and the Clintons, particularly Hillary.

I needed quick meals that were healthy, tasted great, appealed to both my 2-year old and my husband & I, and didn't require 2 hours to prepare or packing up the kids for multiple trips to the grocery store.

People may think they want to indulge, get too drunk, incapacitate themselves with weed, but really they just want to appreciate this fragile moment while the outside world falls down. Your party should facilitate this easeful enjoyment, not lead loved ones to panic through overconsumption. Be present. And remember, you don’t know what’s happening in the morning, so while an orgy might very well be the perfect thing, you don’t want to spend your last night on Earth trying to cajole your friends into a particular kind of revelry. Be present. Clean your apartment until it sparkles. Shower, of course, and anoint your body with fragrant oils, but then wear your most beloved sweatpants. Make a wide selection of delicious food, high in protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Serve wine but also a lovely selection of herbal teas. Juice spritzers, in fancy goblets, will allow your guests to hydrate while feeling opulent. Remember, if someone starts crying, don’t try to shut them down or change the subject.', 'Be present.', 'Eventually, the conversation will flow to other things—typically, to The Past and How Great It Was, Even Though We Didn’t Know It at the Time, and The Future, that shimmering, mercurial beast, constantly breaking our hearts.', 'PART ONE', 'THE SOFTEST', 'INVASION', '1. When the aliens first made contact, Trina and her not-yet-wife, Deeba, threw one of their famous dinner parties for a select group of friends. It wasn’t difficult to keep the guest list small. Everyone was too nervous to travel far, the subways and buses deserted but for the most intrepid or desperate travelers. They invited two beloved couples who happened to live close by, and who wondrously had never met. Emma and Mariam came first, with two types of hard cheeses, three types of olives, gluten-free rice crackers, tubs of spicy hummus. Emma was French and Mariam was from Cairo, so they both really knew how to put together a cheese plate. Their little party was completed by Katharine and Laura, the friendly, easygoing lesbians from Tennessee. They came with copious amounts of alcohol (one can always depend on the lapsed Christians to bring the bar): pale ale for the butches, and drinkable red wine. Introductions were made, drinks were poured, cheese and olives exclaimed over. After a half hour of breezy conversation, Deeba brought out a tureen of her famous fish stew, finished with black pepper and a squeeze of lime. Trina passed around homemade loaves of bread, her one party trick. It was so easy to make, and yet everyone thought she was a magician for adding yeast to water to flour and waiting. The women sopped fragrant soup with crusty bread. A generous feeling swirled around them like a melody, like a scent. The essence of a perfect dinner party.', 'How have we never met before?', 'they asked again and again, but what they were really saying was,', 'How have I only just begun to love you?', 'Throwing a dinner party was all Trina and Deeba could think to do. They had already filled the bathtub with clean water and made sure all of their flashlights had new batteries. They kept checking their most reliable sources on Twitter, as well as Al Jazeera,', 'The New York Times', ',', 'The Guardian', '. Every source said to keep calm, try not to panic, and to stop it with these suicide pacts.', 'Unbelievable', ', the newscasters kept saying, it’s', 'unbelievable', '. That word had been ringing in Trina’s head all day. But what was believable about this world, about her government, about what they were doing to the planet and each other? Furthermore, what did Trina believe in with total certainty? That the sun rose in the morning? That the sky was blue? These aliens could say that the cosmos was being carried on the back of a great platypus and she’d have to believe them. What was more mutable than her own perceptions? Katharine raised her wineglass. Her toast became the answer to Trina’s unspoken questions. At the time, Trina thought this was a coincidence. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Katharine spoke warmly, as if she were telling a long joke. “Lately,” she said, “I’ve felt as if I’ve been living in the wrong timeline. I’ve become numb, like I’m watching my own life as a movie, that is, when I’m not filled with rage or tremendous grief or crippling depression.” \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Deeba hooted and cheered. Emma’s brown eyes twinkled in the candlelight. “Every day, I wake up embarrassed by my country and what we’ve become—” \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 “Ugh,” groaned Mariam. She took on the tone of a newscaster. “Now, more than ever . . . In these trying times . . .” Trina laughed and slapped the table. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0“Let her finish!” chided Deeba. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Katharine cleared her throat. “As I was saying! I’m embarrassed by what we’ve become, and by what we always have been and have never addressed.” \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0“Hear, hear,” said Emma, raising her glass. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0“But tonight,” Katharine continued. “Looking at your beautiful faces, I can finally, safely say that I have no idea what’s coming! I don’t know if this is the end of life as we know it, or the beginning of a grand adventure, or perhaps both. All I have is my uncertainty. And really, that’s all I’ve ever had. Everything else was a lie.” She took a long swallow from her glass. “So cheers, babes. To tonight.” The women clapped and toasted, whistling. Katharine took a half bow and sat down. Laura slung an arm around her wife and grinned. Trina looked across the table at Deeba’s round, brown face. Her cheeks were warm with wine, as pink as the inside of a rose.', 'I know that I love you', ', thought Trina.', 'And that’s enough for me.', 'From across the table, Deeba winked. \xa0 \xa0 After dinner, the women lounged on the floor and got a bit stoned. And then someone decided it would be fun to take a bath. They would soon realize that The Seep had already infiltrated their city’s water supply. They were already compromised, already bodily hosts to their new alien friends. It was through that connection they could hear one another’s thoughts, feel the same emotions, overlaid with the all-consuming adage that Everything Will Be All Right, No Matter What.

With those five famous words, legendary NFL football coach Vince Lombardi communicated his point to his players each year at the beginning of the Green Bay Packers training camp. With pigskin held high in the air, he was telling his team that they must always start with the fundamentals.', '""I can remember my first team meeting ever in the National Football League,"" Super Bowl–winning player and coach Tony Dungy shared with me as he reminisced about his days playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers. ""I was a rookie.', 'Chuck Noll was the coach and the Steelers had won two Super Bowls already. And I thought I was going to hear some fantastic stuff describing how you get to be Super Bowl champions; how you get to be a great player.', '""Coach Noll—I\'ll never forget it—said, \'Champions are champions not because they do anything extraordinary but because they do the ordinary things better than anyone else.\' What he was saying was, you\'ve got this misconception that you\'ve gotta do these spectacular highlight-reel type things, you\'ve gotta have special gifts and special talents to be a Super Bowl winner or an All-Pro. He said, no, that\'s not it. There are fundamentals that it takes to play the game. Executing those fundamentals, not forgetting them, and executing them day in and day out, that\'s how you become great. That\'s how you win. That\'s how you become an All-Pro. And he was right.""', 'Just as knowing and executing the fundamentals of football are key to a player becoming an All-Pro, knowing and executing the fundamentals of fatherhood better and more consistently than everyone else are key to a father becoming an All Pro Dad. Many books, blogs, and seminars do a good job listing things men should say and not say, do and not do as fathers. Men need lists, and lists are good. But we can\'t skip the fundamentals. And the two most important fundamentals of fatherhood are love and leadership. Before you think I\'m getting soft by talking about love, you need to know that love is anything but soft. It\'s strong. James ""JB"" Brown, host of', 'The NFL Today', ', is a big man with a big heart. During one of our visits, JB shared with me that ""People think love is soft and weak, but it is really a sign of strength."" It\'s strong. It\'s powerful. It\'s courageous.', 'What drives a fireman to put on a fifty-pound tank and climb the stairs of the World Trade Center? What inspires a G.I. to storm omaha Beach under a cloud of enemy gunfire? As author G. K. Chesterton wrote, ""The true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him, but because he loves what is behind him."" Love for others is what makes a man a man. And a man\'s love, his manhood, starts with what is right behind him—his family.', 'So in this chapter, we\'ll focus on the fatherhood fundamentals of love and leadership. We\'re going to learn what they really are and why they are so important for fathers. In the next seven chapters we\'ll tackle the ""7 Ms"" that are essential for every man to know to effectively execute those fundamentals—Makeup, Mind-set, Motive, Method, Model, Message, and Master. Every father must know these 7 Ms to expand his capacity to love and, in turn, lead his children well.', 'The First Fundamental—Love', '""Truly, truly, truly love. That\'s the most powerful thing there is."" Those are the words spoken by UCLA\'s legendary basketball coach John Wooden, at the age of ninety-nine shortly before his death. Love\'s power is apparent. But its essence can be tough to grasp. Bookstores and shelves in homes are filled with books on what love is, how to love, what love does and does not do. Unfortunately, many miss the real mark of love.', 'If you asked ten adults what love is, you\'d probably get ten different answers. Love is tough to define. Coach Wooden went on to say, ""The most important word in our language is \'love.\'""', 'Love', 'is the greatest word with the greatest value and the greatest power in the world. The Roman poet Virgil said, ""Love conquers all things."" The great Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy said, ""All, everything that I understand, I understand only because I love."" And the political leader of India, Mahatma Gandhi, said, ""There only is life where there is love. Life without love is death.""', 'The Author of Wisdom clearly tells us that love is the greatest. When the cunning Pharisees asked Jesus of Nazareth, ""Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?"" Jesus replied: ""\'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.\' This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: \'Love your neighbor as yourself.\'""', ""Okay, if you still don't believe love is the most important thing, just go and ask someone who has never really been loved."", 'Myths and Misunderstandings About Love', 'Love is the greatest, but it is also undoubtedly the most overused and underused, misapplied and misunderstood word in the English language. It is overused and misapplied with reckless abandon on most television shows and commercials you watch. Remember the ""I love you, man"" beer commercial? For decades, musicians such as the Beatles have made love their hallmark—""She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah."" The books you read and websites and blogs you look at talk about love as well. It\'s so apparent, examples are probably unnecessary. But I don\'t want you to think that it\'s mostly bad. I like a lot of those shows and songs. I\'m just trying to make the point that we use this amazing word without even thinking about it. As a result, we perpetuate myths about its meaning.', 'Love is also underused and misconstrued in word and deed by husbands, wives, parents, children, grandparents, grandchildren, relatives, friends, and coworkers. Loving others doesn\'t mean liking. We can love others without having to like what they do. My wife, Susan, and I, especially when we\'re having a disagreement, will sometimes say to each other, ""I love you. But I sure don\'t like you right now."" What we\'re really saying is, ""I love you no matter what, but I don\'t like the way you are acting right now.""', 'We apply the word', 'love', 'when we speak of things as well. We say, ""I love my car."" ""I love their french fries."" ""I love that dress."" Sure, those things may be appealing and pleasing to one of our five senses—sight, hearing, taste, touch, smell—but it is not the right application of our love. We weren\'t designed to love inanimate objects. objects are not capable of receiving and giving love; only people are. If we attempt to ""love"" things, then, more often than not, we\'ll use people and end up with shallow relationships, meaningless stuff, and no one to share it with. But if you and I love people, and use things for their intended purpose, we\'ll have rich relationships and lasting joy in life.', 'The Risks of Love', ""Be aware. We may invest a lot of personal time and emotional capital in our spouses or children and not see any kind of RoI—return on investment. But, as we'll soon see, that's what love is all about—investing with no expectation of return. Having said that, we need to remember that all loving involves some risk. Author C. S. Lewis observed:"", 'To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket—safe, dark, motionless, airless—it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable.', 'Genuine Love', ""Do you know how U.S. Secret Service agents determine if money is counterfeit? They don't start by studying counterfeit currency. They start with the real thing. They learn that genuine currency has a texture of raised ink; sharp, fine printing; red and blue color strands; a watermark; serial numbers; and other security features. When they know the real thing, they can easily spot a fake. As we saw earlier, there is a lot of counterfeit love talk in our world today. The best way to spot it? We've got to study the real thing. So let's get to it."", 'While searching for this Holy Grail definition, you need to know something right up front. Thousands of people over the course of thousands of years have worked to define the word', 'love', "". There are as many definitions out there as there are grains of sand on the beach. I shared just a few of them with you earlier. Although I've spent a lot of time researching definitions of love, I'm not going to rehash all of those definitions. I've done the work for you, so let me give it my best shot. you ready? Here is the treasured definition: God is love. That's it. But I know that definition may not satisfy your curiosity, so let's continue to study the genuine nature of love. As we do, please remember that I just gave you the best and most genuine definition of love you'll ever find and nothing else will ever match it."", 'Picture in your mind a wedding at a church. The young bride and groom are on the altar facing each other, hand in hand. Their sparkling eyes and glowing faces complement the flowing wedding gown and tux. The pastor stands before the excited and hopeful couple and says with confidence, ""Love is patient when you', 'feel', 'like being patient, love is kind when you', 'feel', 'like being kind ..."" Right? of course not. He says, ""Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.""', 'In doing so, what is he really saying about love? He\'s saying love is not just a feeling; it is a decision. Love does not say, ""Feel this way."" Love says, ""Act this way."" Love is an act of the will to be patient, kind, gentle, humble, sincere, compassionate, giving, faithful and trusting, forgiving, uniting, and persevering. Love is all about serving and giving selflessly and sacrificially to another person. The best way to spell love? G-IV- E. It\'s looking not only to your own interests but also to the interests of others. It\'s doing what\'s best for others no matter what it costs you personally.', 'Love says, ""I want what\'s best for you! That is why I\'m talking to you about this, that is why I\'m doing this, that is why I\'m making this decision.""', 'Love says, ""No longer will I live my life for me. I will think about self less and you more.""', 'Love says, ""I\'m choosing to be at my best even when you\'re not at your best.""', 'Love says, ""What I want isn\'t important, but what you want is paramount.""', 'The Unconditional Nature of Love', 'As a real estate attorney, I drafted many contracts. In every valid contract there is something called ""consideration."" Consideration is when you give something knowing you will get something else in return. It\'s conditional. It\'s an ""if I do this, then you\'ll do that"" kind of thing. But love is unconditional. Love is not a transaction; it\'s an action. Love is not reciprocal; it\'s sacrificial.', '""So, are you doing this?"" my wife, Susan, asked me as we sat on the couch after she had just read the first draft for this chapter.', '""Doing what?"" I responded.', '""Are you exercising this fundamental of love, unconditional love, with our children?"" she continued.', 'I really thought it was an off-base question. ""yes, of course I am. I\'m constantly telling them that I love them no matter what, and they know I love them unconditionally.""', 'Susan then dug deeper in, saying, ""I know you say that a lot and really mean it, but do your facial expressions, tone of voice, and actions always show it? Think about Marky. Sometimes your looks of disapproval for what he did or didn\'t do, or not being excited about something he is doing might send the opposite message to him."" Susan then went on to give me a couple examples of this.', ""It was a full body slam as I had never thought about it that way. And it hurt. But I thanked Susan and stopped writing for the day as I pondered what she said. I then determined in my mind that I was going to really work on this fundamental. I need to show unconditional love not only with my words, but also with my tone of voice and facial expressions. I've got to get this right!"", 'Grammy Award–winning recording artist Michael W. Smith, father of five and grandfather of five, is a living testimony to the fact that love is never wasted and must be unconditional. ""I\'m a perfect example of a guy who had amazing parents—still do, they\'re my biggest fans,"" Michael shared with me. He then paused as his mind went back many years ago. ""But, you know, I started playing with the fire— alcohol and drugs. I didn\'t think I could get burned. And for four years, I was a mess. I mean, I was a complete mess. I almost died a few times. It\'s crazy.""', 'Michael then seemed to say with a great sense of gratitude, ""And I\'m convinced to this day that part of my rescue was my mom and dad loving me unconditionally, even knowing everything that I was doing. They just loved me. It was unconditional love and they were on their knees for me, especially in my crazy party days here in Nashville. And I think that\'s what you gotta do as a father if your kids have wandered. The best thing you can do for them is just love them and pray for them."" Michael\'s parents\' love for him was not reciprocal during those years; it was sacrificial.', 'Love in Action', 'As I sat with the popular former governor, now businessman, Jeb Bush, in his modest Coral Gables, Florida, office, he paused from his busy workday to reflect upon his life. He thoughtfully shared these intimate thoughts with me, which I pass along to you. ""We all have loving thoughts, but if they remain passive, they\'re completely useless because they don\'t nourish anything. They can actually create resentment. Converting those thoughts into action shouldn\'t take half a lifetime, but in my case, it has. But I\'ve noticed I\'m getting better at loving. I look back at my life and realize things are not as complicated as I thought. Why does it take a half-a-lifetime experience to get to the simple things?"" Love is not passive; it is an action. It\'s something we must demonstrate day in and day out, even when everything inside of us screams, ""No, that person did me wrong, they don\'t deserve it!""', 'Let me give you an example:', '""Hello, Mr. Merrill? This is John Johnson from Tampa Fire and Rescue. Do you know what\'s happened to your home?""', '""No,"" I said into the phone with a questioning tone.', '""Well, you have a major problem in your home. It\'s flooded,"" he added.', '""What?"" I gasped. ""What happened?""', '""I would just suggest you get here quickly,"" he exclaimed.', '""Thank you,"" I said hurriedly as I hung up the phone. I jumped into my car and raced home from the office in the pelting Florida rain. once I pulled into the driveway, I realized what had happened. We were getting a new roof on our historic old house and the workers had taken off the old one but, for whatever reason, they were not able to get a tarp secured to cover the house. So, in came the heavy rain. The attic, second floor, and first floor were all inundated. Beautiful old plaster ceilings fell to the floor, antique furniture was ruined, and clothes were soaked. That night, June 1, 2011, we moved out.', ""Sure, it's tough for my family to be houseless. You get kind of disoriented and feel as though you're in a fog. But we're not homeless. We know where our permanent home really is. And nobody was injured. So basically it was just stuff that was destroyed. Stuff that can be replaced or wasn't really needed."", 'Over the course of the next few days after the flood, we had to do many things, including finding a place to stay for the next eight to twelve months while our home was being rebuilt. But as I thought about it, I determined that the most important thing I needed to do was to be a good example to all the people I would have to deal with through the process— the insurance companies, the adjusters, the contractors, the cleaners, and so on.', ""This incident, which occurred right in the middle of writing this book, would test my resolve. Would I just write about love? Or, would I really live it out? Well, I can tell you that I've failed in some ways, especially in the area of patience, but I'm grateful that I've been given opportunities to increase my capacity to love and demonstrate love to others despite my failures."", '(Continues...)', 'Excerpted from', 'ALL PRO DAD', 'by', 'Mark Merrill', 'Copyright © 2012 by Mark Merrill.

The Longest Trail, Vol. 1;"['Review', 'Five Star Review-', 'The Longest Trail: A True-Life Novel by Roni McFadden is a book for horse lovers. Roni McFadden is a young teen who is damaged.The background of horses, westerns and cowboys is interesting to readers who have no experience of horses. There are some fun stories that the author shares with readers. What I found really inspirational is the spiritual undertone which can be felt while reading the book. It also speaks about the power of horses, the power of trusting, healing and finally transformation.', ""Reviewed By Mamta Madhavan for Readers' Favorite"", ""THE LONGEST TRAIL is the compelling personal journey of the author as she navigates her way through the valley of demons that she must conquer in search of herself. A wise older cowboy, a horse, and the adventures of a lifetime are described in a first-person voice that is so powerful it makes you feel like you are eaves dropping on all her private thoughts.It's a great story, well-told, and written in a literary style that takes you immediately from your world to hers. Put 5-stars on this one...it warrants all five of them."", 'D.B. Jackson, Author~ Unbroke Horses', 'This book is a remarkable testament to the power of horses and healing, and to the power of trust.\xa0She met a man who saved her life by opening up to her a new world of horses, packing, exhausting and rewarding work, the beauty and importance of the outdoors (particularly the scenic Sierra Nevadas), and the awareness of the people who lived in and walked this land before we did.\xa0She is one of the lucky ones to interact with some of these ancient peoples, who showed her the old ways of living and respecting nature.Merri Melde~Author of ""Soul Deep in Horses""Roni McFadden writes her life\'s story as though it were a novel of a young girl set adrift in the California of the 1960s.

All rights reserved.', 'IntroductionWhen I began the research for this book I had a fairly clear idea about where my project might fit within an established historiography. Three decades of social and labor history had provided a persuasive account of the transformation of colonial American artisans into waged workers during a contested transition to capitalism. Building on the work of European scholars, American historians traced the rise of a market society and the decline of customary practices, craft pride, and workshop traditions that were thought to have once forged a powerful social bond between masters, journeymen, and apprentices. This decline was accompanied by a worsening of artisanal working conditions and material fortunes that fostered novel forms of republican political protest and ultimately class struggle. It would be difficult to exaggerate the influence of this view in labor and social history in the last four decades. However, there were also gaps in the literature and—lacking the late-medieval and early-modern research that underpinned the work of their European peers—the most noticeable gap in colonial American history was the surprising dearth of studies of urban skilled workers in the seventeenth and earlier eighteenth centuries.With this in mind I set out to examine the artisanal trades in early New York City, suspending my inquiries at 1760 so as to avoid the gravitational pull of the American Revolution that already held so many excellent studies in its orbit. After several, mostly unsuccessful, forays into the archives I began to appreciate why we knew so little about artisanal work in the earlier colonial period: court minutes and published sources frequently mentioned tradesmen who brought disputes before the magistrates, registered as freemen, paid taxes, or served in the militia; these registers and lists provided the raw data for several sociological analyses of the distribution of wealth, ethnic composition, and occupational structure of New York\'s skilled workforce. But these snapshots revealed a static picture at best, little concerning the ups and downs of daily trade, and still less of the social and political import of artisanal work in the early city. It was then that a chance discovery provided an opportunity to investigate in greater detail the activities of a larger and, I came to believe, more representative sample of city tradesmen. Following a reference to a set of uncatalogued papers, I discovered a substantial collection of miscellaneous legal documents comprising several thousand complaints filed to initiate civil suits in the city\'s Mayor\'s Court. The complaints provided a wealth of detail concerning prices, wages, and the exchanges that constituted the everyday concerns of tradesmen and their customers. As luck would have it, the records were particularly rich for the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries—the period about which so little was known and so much inferred.The Mayor\'s Court Papers revealed that city artisans served a local market and that labor shortages made gainful employment generally easy to find. However, the complaints and related documents—bonds, promissory notes, bail agreements, and witness depositions—also disclosed that as early as the third quarter of the seventeenth century the fortunes of ordinary working men and women were intimately bound up with the Atlantic trade and the commercial development of the city\'s rural hinterland. Tradesmen divided their energies between skilled work and all manner of commercial enterprise, relying on credit to pursue whatever opportunity offered the best return. They participated in the export of furs, tobacco, and plantation supplies, and purchased imported cloth and household goods for resale in the city and its environs. They financed the ventures of others and bought, sold, and rented property; they farmed—raising crops and livestock for local and export markets—and provided food, drink, and lodging for others. In these and their other endeavors, tradesmen were far from independent. They relied on wives, family members, slaves and waged workers for labor and upon partners and patrons for credit, capital, and access to customers for their finished goods and services. Indeed, the closer one looked the more interdependent and impermanent artisans\' fortunes appeared. Skilled practitioners working in all areas experienced success and failure and their commercial strategies seemed to be directed more towards the short-term opportunism of the economy of a bazaar, rather than the orderly pace of craft work usually associated with pre-industrial colonial towns. By the early eighteenth century the commercial logic of the city\'s trading economy encouraged artisans to undertake the reverse of what has previously been considered their usual working practice: rather than mastering one trade in a workshop dedicated to the production of bespoke products for local customers, artisans participated in whatever enterprises and markets promised profits with a minimum of risk.Reading the Mayor\'s Court Papers, it seemed increasingly likely that the view of a general and fundamental shift from independent, amenable, and reasonably rewarded craft work to dependent, alienated, and penurious wage work which had long figured so prominently in studies of early industrialization and class formation had mischaracterized the experience of earlier skilled workers and overestimated the transformative effects of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Moreover, if the uncertainties of the market—the rise and fall of individual fortunes, subcontracting, wage work, and cyclical debt dependency—were already common in New York in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, then their long-supposed intrusion a generation or two later could not adequately account for the form taken by republican and class protests. Protests that contrasted the harsh and unyielding temper of a ""new"" market society with a more affable era of craft work: a lost world of customary mores and workshop practices that was memorialized in countless speeches, banners, and songs, but for which there was little or no evidence in the sources. Rather than continuing to take late eighteenth-century tradesmen at their word, giving credence to their representations of a collective past, my task became the recovery of the world of New York City artisans that preceded the association between skilled work, independence, and virtue that informed the small producer, republican tradition in era of the American Revolution and subsequently.The investigation of this earlier urban scene required that I broaden my focus beyond artisans\' commercial activities to consider the relationship between the practice and perception of skilled work, artisanal status, and community rights in New Amsterdam and early New York City. As a wealth of historical and anthropological studies have shown, work has ever been more than a material and technical pursuit bounded by considerations of location and resource. The organization of productive capacities and employment of skills is also a social process that requires the justification of authority and interests in terms of norms and expectations that change over time; norms and expectations that are only fully intelligible when set within the wider context of contemporary political and legal discourses. Moreover, the universality and mundanity of work affords it a particular significance in the determination of social and cultural meanings for ordinary men and women: the daily repetition of simple tasks and replaying of social roles relieves individual doubts and uncertainties regarding the arbitrary assignment of political and cultural meanings by making such meanings appear routine, normal, and even ""natural."" Above all, the function of work as the source of basic material provision in some cases and of comfort and considerable wealth in others grants it a defining role as', 'the', 'human activity in which aspirations confront possibilities and, once tempered in light of perceived limitations, quickly harden into realities.***My study of the linkage between skilled work and political culture in New Amsterdam and early New York has benefited from the continuing renaissance in New Netherland history and New World Dutch studies. Scholars have demonstrated that towns such as Beverwijck (later Albany) and New Amsterdam were more than fur-trading outposts of the West India Company\'s far flung commercial empire. Communities in early New Netherland sustained diverse economic activities and settler groups who were keen to replicate their orderly Old World origins.Beginning in the late 1640s a merchant pressure-group in New Amsterdam conducted a successful campaign in the name of ancient Dutch freedoms for a municipal government that could manage local trade in the residential or ""burger"" interest. The justification for this campaign drew upon the Dutch tradition of autonomous urban government and protectionism that aimed to provide for community needs through civic, charitable, and commercial institutions—for example, local courts of justice, orphanages, and weigh houses—and the distribution of municipal privileges and liberties including occupational protections and monopolies to nurture local trade. In large Dutch cities such as Amsterdam, Leiden, and Utrecht occupational privileges and liberties were overseen by guilds, themselves regulated by the city government, which monitored standards of workmanship and training, pricing and membership, and assisted members during sickness or old age. In smaller towns, where there were too few practitioners to require guilds and elaborate regulations, citizenship and trade privileges were nevertheless deeply imbricated in popular conceptions of social and moral order and exerted a symbolic significance far beyond the commercial advantage they afforded holders: privileges and liberties constituted and regulated local relations of production and ensured community well-being; they provided for an individual\'s public identity (as citizen and craft practitioner), and for the absorption of newcomers and exclusion of dissidents from the municipal space. By indicating the limits of authoritarian government, privileges and liberties also served as guarantees of individual and community freedoms. Attacks on local privileges, whether real or imagined, were frequently construed as a threat to fundamental liberties and the common good. These privileges, liberties, and freedoms were frequently referred to as rights, but only in the sense that their holders exercised them with or by right. The social and political implications of this objective conception of rights (and what distinguished it from the modern subjective form) provided for the distinctiveness of colonial New York\'s and arguably much of early modern Euro-American political culture. This requires an explanatory note before we proceed further.In their early modern and objective form rights were powers granted for a purpose, broadly speaking the promotion of moral and political order and the common good. Objective rights conveyed the idea that an individual may do something because it was right or, as in the case of early New York, because it accorded with divine and natural law or metropolitan and subsequently local custom. The first thing to note is the close affinity between the objective conception of rights—a term I will use interchangeably with privileges and liberties—and considerations of status or rank. For, as Richard Dagger has argued, to say within this schema that one was a burger or a baker was also to say that one held rights—for example to residential and legal preferment or to the product of one\'s labor—which accorded with one\'s place and function in society. In this sense, rights served as the means by which individuals contributed to an orderly moral and social life which was held as the end of just and legitimate government in accordance with the injunction of divine and natural law.The function of early modern objective rights as the means to the divinely ordained end of orderly moral and social life meant that they were always accompanied by obligations which required holders to employ their powers in the service of the common good. As we shall see, it was in these terms that New Amsterdam\'s bakers were granted protective privileges for their trade in return for meeting their duty to bake bread at a regulated weight and price. In this respect objective rights afforded individuals a justifiable (or rightful) claim to acts that they were under an obligation to perform. Equally importantly, however, they also afforded holders a concomitant right to what others were obliged to render unto them. Thus city bakers invoked their obligation to provide bread for the burghers when justifying demands for regulations that ensured they received their just deserts and prohibited unregistered itinerants from baking and selling bread and cakes in the town.These political and commercial reciprocities bore noteworthy social consequences. For inasmuch as obligations and duties bearing upon rights and privileges specified an individual\'s public behaviour—whether a baker, a burgher, or a burgomaster—they also sustained assumptions concerning the normativity of a prescriptive social hierarchy in which individuals arrayed in their various ranks served different and unequal functions. In so doing the objective form of rights met particularistic and conservative ends by making hierarchical social arrangements both intelligible and justifiable. It is in this sense that objective rights were distinct from the modern notion of subjective rights which rose to prominence with the late eighteenth-century revolutions. In the objective form the idea of right implied a claim, usually considered part of an individual\'s property, to act in accordance with a known and accepted standard of behaviour which held others in its thrall. In the subjective form the themes of property and propriety were united in a self-justifying claim which recognizes that an individual', 'has a right', 'to act in a certain way; a claim in which the concept of rights has become synonymous with the conception of what is right. With the development of this subjective conception, rights are perceived as a primary feature of humanity and provide for the radical claims concerning equality and liberty of the sort advanced during and after the era of the American Revolution. However, and herein lies this study\'s key claim, before the modern conception of subjective rights could gain purchase in the everyday world of ordinary men and women, the idea that individuals were fundamentally alike and entitled to possess universal and equal rights had to supplant the view that differences in rank, culture, and nationality were rooted in immemorial and ""natural"" differences. This is the incremental transformation that we shall be examining from the perspective of the practice and status of artisanal work in colonial New York City.In the first part of the book we consider the creation of a batavianized civic community based on objective rights and privileges on the southern-most tip of Manhattan Island and the implications for the status and fortunes of resident artisans. Chapter one investigates how, beginning in the late 1640s, tradesmen settled in increasing numbers and pursued all manner of opportunities and especially the fur trade in addition to their skilled occupations. In doing so they established a commitment to commercial ambition and diversity that characterized artisanal trade for the remainder of the colonial period. However, when tradesmen came before the city they did so not only as', 'homo economicus', '—or individuals involved in manufacturing, the provision of services, and petty dealing. They also appeared as freeborn subjects and resident burghers who claimed commercial and legal privileges, and as practitioners of occupations deemed essential for the provision of the common good. It was this bundle of identifications that provided for the status of tradesmen in local society and differentiated them from the strangers, women, slaves, and indentured servants who occupied different, and mostly subordinate, positions within the municipal scheme. Although trade skill was an important part of an individual\'s civic identity, it was not the only component. The urban Dutch republican tradition upon which New Amsterdammers drew also emphasized the obligation of residents to undertake militia duty and defend their communities, to conduct their commerce according to the formalities of the Roman-Dutch law, and to defer to the judgement of burgomasters drawn from a local elite who possessed the necessary virtues to qualify for a position in the municipal government.In the late 1650s and early 1660s the town\'s prosperity rested on the deference of middling burghers to civic leaders who rationalized their administration by the claim that it provided for the common good. Chapter two examines how following the conquest in 1664 the defence of this civic order figured in the protracted transition to English rule. Under-resourced and faced with the government of a dispersed and alien population, the English were initially content to maintain the city as an administrative and protected commercial center. The fact that the continuity of municipal privileges and Dutch legal practice was taken by many to indicate the nondespotic character of English rule was a fortunate (if unintended) consequence of English flexibility and ensured a painless transfer of imperial authority. Trouble flared, however, in the 1670s and 80s when the pace of English reforms quickened and the exploitation of local trade and residents by the governors and their merchant cronies was perceived to sacrifice the common good in the interests of a narrow clique. City tradesmen increasingly feared that their local rights and privileges were imperilled by a conspiratorial and arbitrary ruling elite. When these fears became entwined with anti-popery sentiment whipped up by a cadre of Calvinist zealots responding to local and international threats to the Reformed Protestant religion, tradesmen took to the streets as armed militiamen to defend the city and inhabitants from popery and slavery.The militiamen\'s revolt—which was only later identified with its zealous German leader, Jacob Leisler—signalled the beginning of the end of the batavian civic order. In the ensuing four decades amendments in the practice of city government and the law undermined these earlier commitments and provided for changes in the status and perception of local tradesmen. The second half of the book considers these changes and begins with a chapter examining the artisanal trading economy. The decline of the fur business drew city artisans away from dealings with upriver Indian traders and concentrated their commerce in urban credit networks spawned by the burgeoning imports of European goods and the export colonial products. Labor shortages encouraged the shift to slave labor and the opportunities presented by commercial expansion discouraged the city from limiting access to its markets, prompting the decline of freemanship and apprenticeship restrictions. The introduction of the common law erased all vestige of earlier legal practice. As the tolerance of the Mayor\'s Court for claims concerning idiosyncratic privileges and duties diminished assertions concerning rights to property in labor were also obscured by complex and costly common law pleadings. In the process, claims and practices that had once been the subject of local political and legal debate were increasingly viewed as archaic traditions with a consequent reduction in their purchase on the public\'s attention.The direction and ultimate outcome of this sequence of discursive shifts was hidden from those experiencing the incremental changes. However, the diminishing significance of claims for particularistic rights and liberties associated with artisanal work undermined assumptions concerning their place within the broader prescriptive social hierarchy. This muddling, if not yet levelling, of public perceptions of social status had important consequences for the role of artisans in city politics. The establishment of a provincial assembly in the aftermath of Leisler\'s Rebellion sapped the authority and influence of the municipal government and drew city artisans into English-style election contests in which politicians alternated between competing for gubernatorial patronage and challenging the royal prerogative power in the name of ""popular rights."" The potential for instability in partisan politics was limited by the internal coherence and shared values of the provincial oligarchy and the initial disinterest of the predominantly non-English voting population. However, in the 1730s the competition for spoils amongst the provincial elite broke beyond previous constraints, prompting a constitutional crisis that marked a watershed in the city\'s political history. Against the backdrop of a severe economic recession political leaders imported the radical republican ideas of the English ""country"" opposition. Thereafter, provincial politicians championed consent as the foundation of legitimate government and appealed to the equality of interests that united all property-owning men. It was in this context, that the figure of the craft-proud and virtuous artisan, familiar from the late eighteenth-century urban scene, first appeared in New York City politics.The story told here is of the contribution of early New York artisans and the perception of the work they did to the process of political innovation and conceptual change that produced an artisanal subject who came to play a prominent role in radical republican politics. The book\'s central proposition is that the demise of the idea that city tradesmen occupied a particular and privileged place undermined long-held assumptions concerning the natural inequality of man and in so doing provided for the expression of novel conceptions of the social and political status of city tradesmen that figured in the development of a rights-based politics in eighteenth-century America. Or, put more simply, before New York City tradesmen could take on the role of free men possessed of equal rights, they first had to jettison an earlier, late-medieval political culture that secured their status and rights on the basis of their privileged place within a prescriptive local hierarchy. Before we can understand how New York artisans shed their privileged civic status, we must first investigate how they came to possess it in New Amsterdam. And so we begin with Henry Hudson and his fractious crew, as they edged their way down the Atlantic seaboard late in the summer of 1609.', 'Read more']";59.95;Simon Middleton (Author);['Books', 'History', 'Americas'];"{'Publisher': 'University of Pennsylvania Press; Illustrated edition (March 3, 2006)', 'Language': 'English', 'Hardcover': '320 pages', 'ISBN 10': '0812239156', 'ISBN 13': '978-0812239157', 'Item Weight': '1.4 pounds', 'Dimensions': '6 x 0.88 x 9 inches'}";0812239156

The book tells how daddy vampire kisses baby Drac, and shows daddy Bigfoot giving a kiss to his Littlefoot, daddy Cyclops giving his one-eyed Cyclops a kiss, and daddies of Eskimos, dragonettes, invisible boys, were-pups, mini mummies, and Nessie giving them kisses. It is good to see the world of these creatures and the love and affection they express to their babies which resemble the love and kisses by fathers everywhere in the world. So what are you waiting for? Flip through these pages and see how monster little ones are snuggled and kissed by their fathers.\xa0~The content is unique and original, which makes the book a refreshing read. The illustrations are magical and will bring a smile to the faces of all young readers. The words that accompany the illustrations are funny too. They also bring the concept alive and make it clear to readers. The topic is so relevant and I like the way the author handles it with an interesting twist and way of presentation. The little monsters at home and school will find the book cute and adorable. The book evokes a good feeling inside readers as it speaks about fatherly love, affection, and kisses.

The family's beloved, goofy, retired racing greyhound is usually at her side as she writes, quietly keeping her company. Candace writes Urban Fantasy, Paranormal Romance, Contemporary BDSM Romance, and a kick-ass Motorcycle Club series. Her urban fantasy series, Only Human, gives us a world where weredragons, werewolves, werelions, three different species of vampires, and a variety of other mythological beings exist. Candace's two paranormal romance series, The Chattanooga Supernaturals and The Rolling Thunder Motorcycle Club, are both sister series to the Only Human series, and give some secondary characters their happily ever after. Her contemporary Safeword series gives us characters who happen to have some extreme kinks. Relationships can be difficult enough without throwing power exchange into the mix, and her books show characters who care enough about each other to fight to make the relationship work. Each couple in the Safeword series gives the reader a different take on the lifestyle.

Something That Feels Like Truth (Switchgrass Books);"['From', 'Booklist', 'God, they say, is in the details, and for the characters populating award-winning novelist Lystra’s (Season of Water and Ice, 2010) luminous collection of short stories, truth lies there, too. Set in and around the Midwest, from Chicago’s glittering lakefront to Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, Lystra’s tales follow ordinary people as they experience extraordinary wonder through events large and small. A widower confronts the realities of his marriage during a pickup-bar flirtation in “Rain Check,” while a recently separated husband navigates the perilous new world of building relationships in “Speaking of Love Abstractedly.” Fathers and sons, husbands and wives, brothers and friends all find cause for reflection in the quotidian acts of their lives, where perceptions and misconceptions coalesce in often tragic, sometimes illuminating ways. Lystra is a discerning observer of the human condition and a deft communicator of the myriad ways in which best intentions may not always achieve satisfying results.

The Last Valley: Dien Bien Phu and the French Defeat in Vietnam;"['From', 'Booklist', ""In this masterful account of the Battle of Dien Bien Phu of 1953-54, Windrow dissects retrospective criticism of the French strategy. For reasons that emerge within his comprehensive, meticulous analysis, the ideas behind the French strategy at Dien Bien Phu were taken from a prior victorious battle. Generals believed that establishing a ground base deep in Communist-controlled territory and supplying it by air would regain them the initiative against the Viet Minh insurgency. The heart of Windrow's narrative, and implicitly his sympathies, lies with the officers and men who carried out the strategy--and bore its cost as its assumptions were progressively stifled by the Viet Minh commander, the storied Vo Nguyen Giap. As the mobile battle envisaged by French planners degenerates into a wallow of World War I-style attrition, Windrow describes with brutal realism the carnage of the combat, which snuffed out tens of thousands of lives. Many works address Dien Bien Phu's history-altering significance in the Indochina conflict, but for learning about what actually happened there, Windrow's will be difficult to surpass."", 'Gilbert Taylor', 'Copyright © American Library Association.

It tells the story of the ghastly French experience in Indo-China in a way that has never been done before in English. The account of Dien Bien Phu is a masterpiece of meticulous historical narrative\' (Max Hastings ) \'Success in battle, according to one military maxim, may not, on its own assure the achievement of national security goals, but defeat will guarantee failure.

Martin Windrow has pulled off a remarkable feat.\' (SUNDAY TIMES ) \'Enthralling...Windrow gives a clear and cogent analysis of the general politico-military position, one that makes the fateful decision to invite a Viet Minh attack on Dien Bien Phu understandable... Anyone who found Stalingrad absorbing will find this book equally so. Like Beevor, Windrow gives one the very essence of battle... His character sketches of individuals from commanding officers down, are deft and accurate... This book is a wonderful account of a terrible battle...\' (Alan Massie LITERARY REVIEW ) \'Martin Windrow\'s The Last Valley is the vividly told story of a miniature Stalingrad in which 10,000 French troops were besieged by a large army of Viet Minh for fifty-seven days, fifty years ago.\' (HISTORY TODAY ) \'...Dien Bien Phu, as Martin Windrow\'s moving and judicious account of the battle and of the two armies that fought it shows, was not at all a straightforward clash between the French and Vietnamese... Windrow tells it with great lucidity and humanity, with vivid portraits of the leading French officers, and... a very fair assessment of the internal dramas of Dien Bien Phu... he also offers asides on weaponry, battlefield medicine, morale... which are among the best elements of this good book.\' (Martin Woollacott THE GUARDIAN ) \'Windrow has achieved a remarkable feat... The account is full of nice touches... A master of every detail, Windrow captures both the ""prodigious human exertions"" of the barefoot Viet Minh troops and the ""courage and fighting skills"" of the French legionnaires.\' (THE WEEK ) --Professor Richard HolmesPlenty of books have been written on Dien Bien Phu, but I think Martin Windrow\'s account of the battle is the best account of it yet. The French defeat in Vietnam is a classic example on how not to conduct a war. The French objective was to hang onto Indochina. But there never was any sufficient commitment to convincingly support this objective. The Vietnamese on the other hand had a very clear objective - getting rid of the invader - and whilst their tactics were not terribly sophisticated, they eventually carried that objective all the way to victory. Martin Windrow has written a meticulously researched book on the subject. He brings the human element to the foreground rather than getting lost in recounting logistics and detail of individual units. What particularly yelled out to me when I read the book was the suffering endured by both the French and the Vietnamese at Dien Bien Phu. If you are interested in the Vietnamese War then this is a must-read. --By Thomas Koetzsch', 'About the Author', 'Martin Windrow', 'is an associate of the Royal Historical Society and a member of the Foreign Legion Association of Great Britain.

Whistle: A New Gotham City Hero;"['From School Library Journal', ""Gr 8 Up—Sixteen-year-old Willow Zimmerman lives in Down River, a borough of Gotham City. She is an activist for school funding and befriends a new classmate, Garfield, who has just moved to town after growing up in Nigeria. She works late shifts at an animal shelter to help support her mother, who is battling cancer. An opportunity arises when her mom's old friend E. Nigma comes to town offering Willow a large salary for helping organize exclusive events for his friends and clients. Willow accepts, and the money is an enormous help, but she begins neglecting Garfield. She also befriends Pammie Isley, a die-hard environmentalist and one of Nigma's cohorts. The first two-thirds or so of this story is a street-level view of Gotham City as led by a spunky, conscientious teenager. There are references to and cameos from the DC universe, but Willow is definitely the star. Willow and her mom are Jewish, and there is information about Gotham's Jewish history and culture, dialogue about mitzvahs and tikkun olam, and settings ranging from a synagogue to stores with names like Moishe's, Rosen Bros. Delicatessen, and Shelsky's Bagels. Willow struggles to balance personal, social, and professional goals, especially when a big payday requires her to compromise her morals. The third act, in which Willow quickly gains and uses some canine powers to foil Nigma and Isley's criminal enterprise, feels out of place and unnecessary. Preitano's sharp, angular art depicts Willow and Gotham as having many layers and sides—superheroics somehow drain the color from both. Willow, her mother, E. Nigma, and Pammie are white; Garfield is Black.

Whatever Happened to Thrift?: Why Americans Don't Save and What to Do about It;"['From Publishers Weekly', ""It's a much bemoaned fact that Americans who fail to sock money away in savings accounts and investments risk severe hardship once they hit retirement age or fall on tough times. What's far less obvious is how to turn these overspenders into savers. Wilcox draws insights from economics and psychology to tackle this challenge in his slim but sensible volume. His analysis of our prodigal ways is slight—a historian or cultural critic might have handled this question with more depth and aplomb—but his policy prescriptions are comprehensive, insightful and well argued. Wilcox explores radical measures, such as replacing the income tax with a consumption tax, as well as simple and easily implemented programs such as automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans and requiring more fee disclosure from investment firms. He observes that current incentives skew toward the wealthy and highlights ways to give lower-income Americans access to savings vehicles like mutual funds. As Wilcox wisely notes, there's no magic bullet for America's savings crisis, but a patchwork of practical solutions, small and large, could significantly increase workers' long-term financial security."", '(June)', 'Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Eating the Honey of Words: New and Selected Poems;"['From Publishers Weekly', 'Heeded in the \'60s as the head apostle of the ""Deep Image"" school of poets; known for ""read-ins"" against the Vietnam War; and heralded again recently as the author of the men\'s movement guide Iron John, Bly has been famous several times over. But this broad set of poems from his whole career reveals how detrimentally little his style has changed. Fond of would-be archetypal terms like ""the darkness,"" ""fields,"" ""stones,"" and ""the body,"" Bly seeks simplicity, knowledge of the collective unconscious, solidarity with nature and confidence in his desires: these projects entail, usually, a drastic distrust of subtlety and a near-total repudiation of intellect. Some of Bly\'s lines make parody pointless: ""My body was sour, my life dishonest, and I fell asleep""; ""As for me, I want to be a stone! Yes!""; ""The bear between my legs/ has one eye only,/ which he offers/ to God to see with""; ""In late September many voices/ Tell you you will die""; ""More of the fathers are dying each day./ It is time for the sons""Athis last from ""Winter Privacy Poems at the Shack."" Some of Bly\'s mannerisms blossomed into brilliance in the work of his late contemporary James Wright; Bly himself has written a few standout poems, most recently the bizarre ""An Afternoon in June."" But Bly\'s real and impressive aural skills, his sense of what is easily effective, and his self-assurance, allow him to go on writing what are at bottom the same lines over and over, whether their catalyst is Vietnam, or sex, or the California coast. One might say of Bly\'s work, as he says of ""The Storm,"" ""It lacked subtlety and obeyed/ Something or someone irresistible""; most of his poems now seem easy to resist. Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.', '--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.', 'Review', '""Robert Bly\'s', 'Eating the Honey of Words', 'has a hearty, booming funk."" --', 'Wall Street Journal', '""[A] delightfully diverse collection."" --', '--', 'New Age', '--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.', 'From Library Journal', 'At 73, Bly continues a long career given, like that of fellow poet Robert Francis, ""to seeing what is far away."" A guide to concealed spiritual powers and champion of activist movements (the anti-Vietnam War movement, the men\'s movement), Bly may want ""To sit here,/ Take no part, be called away by wind,"" but he embraces numerous roles: editing off-beat anthologies and books, translating international poets, and writing poetry that seeks to be receptive to the primitive and the sophisticated, the ""wild"" and the ingenious. Collecting over 200 poems from 1950 to 1998, this volume is an appealing poetic sampler, although the ten new poems are unexciting. The poems celebrating discoveries Bly makes when alone and silent are always striking, and his imaginative prose poems radiate witty delight. This selection shouldn\'t be confused with a true representation of the full body of Bly\'s work, but it is useful for libraries needing a readable overview of 50 years of thought-provoking poetry.AFrank Allen, Northampton Community Coll., Tannersville, PA Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.', '--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.', 'From', 'Booklist', 'Bly\'s lasting fame will probably be as the most influential voice of the men\'s spirituality movement and, before that, as perhaps the most highly visible writer among anti^-Vietnam War protesters. He has maintained his primary public identity as a poet, however, though critics have seen his other activities as draining the creative impetus out of his poetry, and that was the nicest thing they said. His best work has mostly portrayed a life rooted in a homeland and steady ways of livelihood--his place is rural Minnesota; his familial, if not his own, livelihood is farming--as a springboard to universal consciousness. His apocalyptic antiwar poem, ""The Teeth Mother Naked at Last,"" is splendid of its kind; several', 'Point Reyes Poems', ""(1974), most of which are in prose, effectively confront nature; and newer poems concerning his father's death are starkly powerful.

Love & Profanity: A Collection of True, Tortured, Wild, Hilarious, Concise, and Intense Tales of Teenage Life;"['From School Library Journal', ""Gr 8 Up—Short yet powerful autobiographical stories comprise this collection of consistently excellent, vivid writing. The 43 authors from various backgrounds include a few YA well-knowns—John Scieszka, Joseph Bruchac, Carrie Mesrobian, Will Weaver—and many new and upcoming names. The stories reflect the writers' adolescent experiences with conflict, bullying, family, school, friendship, unrequited love, sex, and more. They offer appeal mostly for high school teens and even adults, though there are several that would be appropriate for upper middle schoolers. Love, or the abysmal lack of it, is central to many of the stories, while profanity is primarily reflected in situations rather than word choice (though the language is occasionally graphic). The stories are, by turns, edgy, nostalgic, poignant, sad, and humorous, with some offering a combination of these qualities. Each selection is heartfelt and thought-provoking and could be a catalyst for intensive discussion. VERDICT Readers of Break These Rules: 35 YA Authors on Speaking up, Standing out, and Being Yourself edited by Luke Reynolds (Chicago Review, 2013) and Dear Teen Me: Authors Write Letters to Their Teen Selves edited by E.

Sure to give hope to aspiring writers, then, this collection offers models for how ordinary moments turn into stories, and ordinary kids turn into storytellers.-- ""Bulletin of the Center for Children\'s Books""More than 40 brief true stories from Pete Hautman, Alison McGhee, Adam Rex, Jon Scieszka and others address a vast range of experiences and emotions that will be painfully familiar to teens or anyone who ever was one. . . .Hilarity, heartache, terror, regret, shame, and self-awakening can all be found in this collection of finely wrought moments in time.-- ""Publishers Weekly""Short yet powerful autobiographical stories comprise this collection of consistently excellent, vivid writing. . . .The stories are, by turns, edgy, nostalgic, poignant, sad, and humorous, with some offering a combination of these qualities. Each selection is heartfelt and thought-provoking and could be a catalyst for intensive discussion.-- ""School Library Journal""These well-written and intensely personal reminiscences are often raw and gritty, exposing the realistic, and not always admirable, behavior of typical adolescents.

You can read more about Clint at No Idea What I’m Doing: A Daddy Blog. It’s been featured on Good Morning America, The New York Times, and The Washington Post. But that’s not the real reason to read it. The real reason is that it will give you a glimpse into the steamy world of adult married life with children, and because he sometimes writes about farts. Pete Hautman\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 “Vietnam, Minnesota” Pete Hautman lives in Minnesota, where he writes whatever he feels like writing, from time travel adventures like The Obsidian Blade to vampire-free romances such as The Big Crunch.

Andrew Gottlieb\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 “Ambush” Andrew Gottlieb lives in Irvine, California, and spends more time than he should letting fly fishing get in the way of his writing. Remarkably, he now helps raise two teenagers. He prefers road trips to work of any sort. Find him at www.andrewcgottlieb.com. Natalie Singer\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 “A Ghost in the Mall” Natalie Singer was born and half-raised in Montreal, Canada, before being uprooted and moved―at age 16―to the mythical, ice-cream-colored land of California, where she had to finish raising herself. There, she discovered burritos, tried to become cool on the streets of San Francisco, and made out with lots of frogs before she finally found a prince. She's now a writer in Seattle. Alexis Wiggins\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 “A Most Dangerous Game” Alexis Wiggins has been writing since she was five years old, when she wrote her first story, called The Lincoln Magic Penny; it was written on her dad's typewriter and may have been the best thing she ever wrote. Alexis loves: reading, teaching teenagers, New York City, lemons, Spain, her hubby and her two little boys. Alexis hates: the feeling of biting into peach fuzz, camping, mean people, and turbulence.

Nomad: Girl Without a World;['From', 'Booklist', 'McKeever takes the YA know-how he established on Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane and applies it to Nomad, late of Captain America, a teen refugee from an alternate reality. Her isolation is used to good effect for readers who may be familiar with a sense of exclusion, as a secret empire tests its new method of mind control on Nomad’s high school, turning normal students into a group of rabble-rousers who exact a heavy price from those who don’t fall into line. The suggestion that outcasts are being created by a shadowy conspiracy is a small stroke of genius that many teens will embrace as a paranoid amplification of their own social world. Baldeon’s art is strong on action if slightly less so on faces and expressions, but Nomad’s doomed attempts to establish connections deepen the emotional investment, and guest stars the Young Avengers offer a little something extra. Though it uses characters and ideas from some obscure corners of Marvel’s history, no prior knowledge is needed to enjoy this only slightly didactic whiz-bang adventure.

The Water's Edge (The Southampton Trilogy Book 2);"['From Publishers Weekly', 'At the start of this intense crime novel from Shamus-winner Judson (', 'The Darkest Place', ""), the brutal murder of two drug couriers on a Southampton, N.Y., bridge unleashes old demons for ex-boxer Jake Bechet, a former enforcer for the ruthless South American Castello family, and reclusive PI Tommy Miller, the son of a corrupt police chief. The organizations each one worked for coerce Bechet and Miller into locating the killers who threaten the lucrative status quo. The Castello family thrusts Bechet back into the life he left with implicit threats to the woman he loves. Miller faces similar pressure from the police chief who replaced his father. The two men race to extricate themselves and their loves from a situation which easily confuses allies, friends and enemies, and violence is the coin of the realm. Cold, rainy, foggy weather lends atmosphere to a gripping thriller perfect for a stormy night's entertainment."", '(June)', 'Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', '--This text refers to an alternate', 'kindle_edition', 'edition.', 'From', 'Booklist', 'Former professional boxer Jake Bechet lives modestly and quietly in the glitzy Long Island beach resort of Southampton with Gabrielle. Former PI and knight errant Tommy Miller lives there, too. His lifestyle is almost reclusive. Both men conduct themselves with the furtiveness of clandestine agents in enemy territory. But when two men are executed mob-style, Bechet’s and Miller’s tormented pasts surface, and each is compelled to investigate the murders. Their lives, and the lives of the people they love, depend on their success, and the body count soon rises. The Water’s Edge has a lot to offer crime fans: a richly cinematic portratit of a posh resort in late winter, lashed by rains and socked in by fog; complicated protagonists; really evil mobsters; possibly corrupt cops; and a labyrinthine plot that unwinds in just 24 hours. The book’s weakness lies in the author’s overwriting. Too often, after showing the reader Bechet’s courage or Miller’s pain, Judson then tells us about it. Sometimes twice, in italics. Still, the sense of place and the troubled protagonists will keep readers entertained. --Thomas Gaughan', '--This text refers to an alternate', 'kindle_edition', 'edition.', 'From the Back Cover', 'Two men have been hanged from\xa0the Shinnecock Bridge, their hands severed.

He now lives in Connecticut.', '--This text refers to an alternate', 'kindle_edition', 'edition.', 'Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved.', 'CHAPTER ONE', 'He couldn’t shake the feeling that he had forgotten something, and not long after walking through his door he narrowed it down to whether or not he had turned off the quartz heater he used to keep warm as he worked. It would have been easy, as beat as he was after a long day of gutting the restaurant’s bathrooms to get at a plumbing problem, for such a thing to have slipped his mind. Grueling work, tearing out perfectly good dry wall to get at pipe, more so because he had to do it alone, couldn’t afford to hire help. Plus he knew very little about plumbing, was clearly in over his head, but a restaurant—a successful restaurant—could be a gold mine, would set him up for life, if he was lucky, and certainly that was worth doing whatever needed to be done.', 'Of course, he probably had turned the heater off, had done so without thinking—so much of what he did these days was habit by now, and he could see himself, if he thought about it, just walking right past the still-running unit in his hurry to get out of there and get home, get himself clean and warm and dry and then have nothing at all to do except rest up for tomorrow’s long day. But he couldn’t chance that he hadn’t turned it off, knew that much at least; the last thing he needed was a fire and the investigation that would follow. It would be likely, should his place suddenly burn to the ground, that the authorities would suspect arson—he was so far over his head financially, and Memorial Day was approaching fast, how could they not? But even if he had shut the damn heater off, even if he could to talk himself into believing that, into seeing himself doing that before he left, there would still be a doubt somewhere in his mind, and that would mean a night of troubled sleep. The last thing he really needed was that.', 'No, there wasn’t any choice in the matter. He had to drive back and check.', 'He had parked his pickup truck in the lot behind his apartment building, hurried to it now through the rain—rainiest March on record, the weatherman had said this morning— and climbed in behind the wheel, cranking the ignition. The engine was running rough, but he expected that; there was a problem in the wiring he had been unable as of yet to fix. Everything he owned was a fixer-upper, but if the restaurant was a hit, if the summer was everything he hoped it would be, and if he made it through that first winter, when nine out of ten restaurants on the East End failed, then everything would change, everything he needed he could simply have, easily have, and he would no longer need to scramble around for money. And wasn’t that what all this was about?', 'He shifted into gear, steered out of the back lot and made his way through the village to Hill Street. A little more than a mile later, where the two-lane road opened up and became Montauk Highway, the speed limit jumping from thirty up to fifty-five, he eased down on the accelerator and followed the shimmering road west, moving at an even sixty miles per hour toward violence.', 'The restaurant was on the other side of the Shinnecock Hills, on the eastern edge of the canal. He made the ride there in silence, didn’t want to risk hearing anything more on the radio about the record-breaking rain; he’d live and die by the weather soon enough, when the restaurant opened. Just after he passed the hills and reached the bridge that spanned the canal—one of three, all within sight of his restaurant’s deck—he veered right onto North Road. Tide Runner’s, a single-story building on the water’s edge, was the first left after that. He rolled into the lot, over the packed dirt and broken seashells and through the long puddles, parked and killed the lights. Grabbing his keys from the console between his front seats, he climbed out and headed for the set of plank stairs that led down to the restaurant’s door.', 'Inside, the place was dark and cool, like a cave. He didn’t bother to turn on any lights; the entire west side of the building was a series of large glass windows that let in the light from the canal, which was as brightly lit as a border crossing. Plenty of light, then, for him to see by. He made his way past the long bar and through the dining room to the kitchen. Pushing the swinging door open, he felt a current of dry, hot air against his face and knew that he had, in fact, left the heater running. The sound of the rain pounding on the roof had probably caused him not to hear the hum of the unit and therefore forget all about it in his rush to get home. He switched the heater off, then gave its power cord a tug, pulling its plug from the wall socket. Simply flipping a power switch seemed too little of a thing to have brought him all the way back here like this. He was on his way through the dining room, in a second rush to get out of there and get home, when he heard something that made him stop short.', 'He wasn’t sure what it was, only that he had definitely heard something. Something strange. It came from outside, he knew that much, beyond the glass and wood that surrounded him. The restaurant, like most places by the water, was solidly built, but not so much as to keep outside noises from finding their way in. The more he thought about it, the more he thought what he had heard was a scream. A man’s scream. Very little could be mistaken for that. Still, he immediately doubted himself—it could have been the cry of a gull or maybe even the squeal of a tire, from some car suddenly braking on the Montauk Highway bridge. Who, after all, would be out there on a night like this? The Montauk Highway bridge was visible from where he stood, and looking toward it he saw nothing, no cars stopped or about to crash, just the steel bridge standing solemnly in the rain. He looked then at the deck just beyond the large window. Empty now, in the summer it would be, he hoped, full of people eagerly and freely spending money. He looked for a gull but saw no sign of one, not sitting on a railing or riding the steady current of air moving through the canal. Finally, he looked toward the train bridge, which of the three bridges— Montauk Highway to the south, Sunrise Highway to the north, the train bridge in the center—was nearest to the restaurant, no more than a hundred feet or so away. It was a narrow span of riveted steel that crossed the water, no more than thirty feet above it. Something there caught his eye, some kind of motion on the far side of it. Several long seconds of him staring at the bridge was what was needed for his brain to make sense of what his eyes were detecting.', 'Something was hanging from the bridge. Swaying, not rhythmically, as it would if its motion were caused by the wind, but frantically, violently even. Finally his mind was able to make sense of what he was seeing, put together what exactly it meant.', 'Someone was hanging from the bridge—not from its edge but well below it. A man, his head bent forward at a sharp angle and his feet kicking wildly.', 'There was no mistaking it then, as much as he wished this were a mistake, that this wasn’t at all what was happening.', 'Someone was being hanged.', 'This wasn’t the only motion, though. Directly above this dangling man was what appeared to be a scuffle among three men—two standing, one prostrate, each of the two standing figures bent at the waist. One of these figures dropped to his knees, raised his hand over his head and brought it down, then raised it again and brought it down a second time. A hacking motion more than a punch. Each time the man’s hand came down, another quick scream broke and echoed, muffled by the rain, down the length of the canal.', 'The scuffle ended after that, and seconds later the figure of another man suddenly appeared below the bridge. This man didn’t fall but was instead lowered slowly—first his legs came into view, kicking, and then his body till he came to a stop at the rope’s end. The man hanging beside him, just a few feet away, was no longer moving now, simply hanging limp, his arms at his sides, his body twisting stiffly in the wind.', 'It was then, his breath beginning to fog the glass before him, that he witnessed two men running from the bridge, heading toward the other side of the canal, the Hampton Bays side. They were nothing more to him than two dark figures in motion, one right behind the other. Clearing the bridge quickly, they disappeared from his sight, following the train tracks west, leaving the two bodies hanging dead, or close enough to it, above the dark, rushing water.', 'Back in his truck—he had been overcome by the reflex to run, to just get out of there, and so he had bolted from his place as if it were on fire—he fumbled for the cell phone in the pocket of his jeans, dug it out and dialed 911 with trembling fingers.', 'CHAPTER TWO', 'A half mile east of the canal, in a dark cottage, Jake Bechet awoke to the sound of rain. He lay still for a while, adrift, then finally sat up, careful not to disturb the woman still asleep beside him. The darkness to which he had awakened was total, so he wouldn’t have been able to see the woman even if he looked for her, not that he needed to; he knew by the sound of her breathing that she was still sound asleep. Her name was Gabrielle Marie Olivo. Five foot ten, more beautiful, he thought, than he deserved, easily more so than he was used to. Black hair worn short because long hair was a bother, slender but not without strength, naked now, the way she always slept, even in the dead of winter, curled upon herself between satin sheets, the only carryover from her former life as a daughter of privilege. The cottage was her place, a year-round rental, the bed her bed. Bechet felt this way even though he had slept beside her, without a single day’s exception, for a little more than a year. A long time for him—and for her, too, from what he gathered.

Communication for Social Change Anthology: Historical and Contemporary Readings;"['Review', ""An engine for social change that would improve all our lives has been popping up in different forms for a long time. But now, The Communication for Social Change Anthology looks at an essential ingredient that has usually been left out of the fuel for such an engine. And that ingredient is a form of communication that involves real listening, communication that is different from broadcasting because it goes both ways. This idea is flowering at just the right time because it is becoming increasingly clear that communication that doesn't go both ways doesn't go anywhere. We've been looking for the engine that would not break down on us, that would not carry only a few of us forward. This book may hold, finally, the blueprints for that engine and the fuel it can run on. --Alan Alda, Actor, Writer and DirectorChange happens in many ways. However, sustained social change relies upon people to endure: the power of people to advocate for the change that will benefit them, the power of people to negotiate through their differences, and the power of people to come together, to form social movements, in order to demand their rights. This anthology recognizes this and has collected an impressive group of authors -- including some 14 African contributions -- that through the past half century have reflected upon the role of communication in such processes of social change. Communication for social change, as represented in this collection, is an important component in our common cause. --Graca Machel, Chancellor, University of Cape Town, President and Founder of Mozambique's Foundation of Community Development and Chair of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation Fund""]";45.74;N/A (Author, Illustrator),  Alfonso Gumucio-Dagron and Thomas Tufte (Editor);[];"{'Publisher': 'Communication for Social Change Consortium, Inc.; 1st edition (August 21, 2006)', 'Language': 'English', 'Paperback': '1067 pages', 'ISBN 10': '0977035794', 'ISBN 13': '978-0977035793', 'Item Weight': '4.8 pounds'}";0977035794

The Oneida Creation Story (Sources of American Indian Oral Literature);"['From Library Journal', ""This is the first time that the Oneida Creation Story, perhaps the most completely documented representation of human and world origins in North America, has been simultaneously reproduced in English and the Oneida language. This account is one of a number of versions in which the basic ancient and traditional elements of this tale are preserved. Key elements of Iroquoian cosmology include the Sky-World, the fall of Sky-Woman and her landing on Turtle's back, the origins of humankind and society, and the moral battles between the brother Twins. The book's history of the research on the Oneida Creation Story, which documents temporal changes in format and plot, is highly useful, and the editors include three lexicons organized by phrase, word, and stem. An appendix provides two additional early English versions of the Oneida text. Lounsbury (Oneida Verb Morphology) and Gick (linguistics, Univ. of British Columbia) have done a great service to Oneida linguistic studies, the discipline of linguistics, and, most importantly, the efforts to preserve the Oneida language.DJohn E.

Takedown (Gavin Pierce Series #2);"['From Publishers Weekly', ""After his faith-based tale of a demon serial killer who shocked New York in Driven, Griffiths brings the evil Krogan back to continue his reign of terror in the world of professional wrestling in this rather lukewarm sequel. Det. Gavin Pierce and his pregnant wife, Amy, are happily settling into married life and trying to put the past behind them. But it's not long before the imprisoned Krogan (captured in a tortoise's body at the end of the last novel) finds a way to escape, wreaking mayhem as a professional wrestler and taking revenge on the Pierces. And if Krogan isn't enough of a headache, Gavin also finds himself coping with a terrorist who is bent on committing homicide on a grand scale. The action soon peaks in the wrestling ring, and the final showdown between Gavin and Krogan is almost a footnote. While the novel graphically portrays the reality of evil and provides some entertaining segments, it lacks the originality and strength of its predecessor. One of the most disappointing aspects of the book is the character of Amy, who began her fictional life as a sassy, brainy woman and ends up here as a helpless victim who whines, decorates the house and gets in the way. Dialogue is heavy in spots, and the gore occasionally goes over the top for faith-based fiction (one victim is found with a Scripture verse carved into his chest). Fans of the first book will likely find this one a bit of a letdown.

In', 'Driven', ""(2002) Krogan was exorcised by Reverend Buchanan and banished--with Pierce's help--into the body of a giant tortoise. But the reverend is dying, and Krogan uses the opportunity to escape his cold-blooded prison. Free at last, the ancient demon finds a human host in professional wrestler Jackhammer Hoban. The wrestling milieu provides Krogan with plenty of opportunities for aberrant behavior and a public platform on which to expound his evil message. Pierce, who'd hoped to return to the mundane world of street crime, is instead drawn into battle with the darkest forces that confront humankind. Griffiths presents his Christian thriller in a standard good-versus-evil framework but avoids preachiness by tapping into the same subconscious dread of the devil that made"", 'The Exorcist', ""such a disturbing film.

Fashion historian Daniel Delis Hill takes readers on a fascinatingly detailed tour of America\'s changing sartorial landscape, tracing menswear from the tailors and ""slop shops"" of the early nineteenth century to Calvins, tattoos, and the Armani tux. Each chronological section covers the full range of men\'s clothing by category, including suits and evening wear, outerwear, sportswear, accessories, sleepwear, swimwear, underwear, and grooming. Documenting the panorama of men\'s dress with 650 illustrations (many never before gathered in book form), Hill describes the social developments that contributed to and sprang from changing styles of masculine clothing.

No Girls Allowed (Dogs Okay) (Secrets of a Lab Rat);"['From School Library Journal', 'Grade 3–5—Nine-year-old Scab McNally has an overactive imagination and is on a mission, which is a worrisome combination. He enjoys dabbling in his homemade science lab in his basement and is ecstatic when he develops a particularly obnoxious-smelling sister repellent. Scab and his ""smart times ten"" twin do not get along at all, hence the need for the repellent. When Isabelle refuses to help him convince their parents to get a dog, he decides to sell his repellent to his friends; with the money, he plans to buy a puppy on his own. Unfortunately, his plans hit a bump when he and his best friend have an argument and his latest batch of repellent, which is in his backpack, is accidentally squashed. At the same time Isabelle has decided to help Scab—until she learns why kids have been teasing her at school. Scab is a likable, free-thinking boy who is full of charm and humor. He leaps before he thinks and that gets him into more trouble than he can handle. His many tips, diagrams, and facts scattered throughout are entertaining, as are the numerous comical black-and-white illustrations. This is the first book in a series, and kids are sure to be wondering what kind of trouble Scab will brew in his lab next.—', 'Wendy Woodfill, Hennepin County Library, Minnetonka, MN', 'Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', 'From', 'Booklist', 'Always in trouble, Scab McNally flicks gooey snotballs, arm-farts the national anthem in school assembly, eats crunchy bugs in class, and makes wicked comments about his fourth-grade teachers’ warts, spit, and bad breath. He does have a soft side: his dream is to have “a dog to love, a dog to love him back.” He is saving to buy a pet by selling his special stinky spray (don’t ask what it is made of), which he calls “sister-repellent,” named in honor of his brilliant twin, Isabelle. Disaster strikes when the spray spills in the classroom. The first in a new series, Secrets of a Lab Rat, this will grab elementary-school boys with the uproarious, yucky details and irreverent view of authority, as well as the mushy reconciliation, when his sister helps Scab get his dog.

Voices in Your Blood: Discovering Identity Through Family History;"['From Library Journal', ""Vandagriff, a Polish and Soviet affairs expert by training, offers a new kind of introductory guide to genealogy: a highly autobiographical work that teaches one how to unearth one's past by following the procedures she used to search for her own family. Both entertaining and educational, this guide places family history in a historical context. Equally valuable is its treatment of computer use for genealogical research, including FamilySearch, the Family History Library's computer system on CD-ROM, and genealogy software. More traditional subjects are also covered: census data, surnames, and vital, military, and immigration records. Newcomers to family history research may find this novel-like book more approachable than traditional handbooks as a first resource.

In and Out of Harm's Way : A History of the Navy Nurse Corps;"['From', 'Booklist', ""In nearly 400 pages of densely written and printed text, retired navy nurse Sterner provides what likely will stand for some time as the definitive history of the Navy Nurse Corps. Inspired by the American Red Cross Nursing Service, the navy founded the corps in 1908, and navy nurses have served in ever more responsible positions and in larger numbers in every war since. The corps gave the navy the first female admiral and produced many remarkable and hitherto obscure leaders. Its members survived captivity as POWs as well as harassment and lack of cooperation from their superiors, and they generally pulled their weight even when some would rather have seen them fail. Sterner assumes enough background knowledge of U.S. naval history and women's issues on the reader's part for the book to be less than completely easy reading for those lacking it, but those willing to do catch-up study while reading Sterner will find the whole experience abundantly rewarding."", 'Roland Green']";50.39;Doris Sterner (Author);['Books', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks', 'Medicine & Health Sciences'];"{'Publisher': 'Navy Nurse Corps Assn; 2nd Printing edition (January 1, 1998)', 'Language': 'English', 'ISBN 10': '0897167066', 'ISBN 13': '978-0897167062', 'Item Weight': '2.46 pounds', 'Dimensions': '8.5 x 1 x 11.25 inches'}";0897167066

The rest is history! The garden now spans one fourth of an acre! When their children graduated from school, the couple relocated to rural Missouri where they now reside with their four dogs.

She wasn’t even here for the open practice the Celtics had run today, their last practice before they would begin the regular season tomorrow night against the 76ers.Though she had to admit that it was pretty cool to sit with the other kids and their parents inside the Celtics’ practice gym at the Sports Authority Training Center at HealthPoint, which didn’t so much sound like the name of a basketball court but the answer to some kind of essay question.\xa0The Celtics had scheduled their annual Kids Day practice at four o’clock so that the parents—moms mostly, Molly noticed that right off—could pick up their kids at school or at the bus and get them here on time. Molly, who’d gotten out here to Waltham early, had watched a lot of them pull up to the entrance to the big public parking lot on the side, feeling as if she were watching some kind of parade for SUVs.\xa0Yuppie limos, her mom liked to call them.\xa0Of course, then her mom would wonder if anybody in America even used the word yuppie anymore, or if there was some kind of new description for all the moms driving Suburbans and Land Cruisers and Explorers.\xa0“Pretty soon there’ll be double-decker versions of these monsters,” Jennifer Parker would say to Molly. “Like our red London buses.”\xa0When they had finally come back for good from London, the only place Molly had ever thought of as home, her mom had acted as if everything was new to her, as if the country she’d grown up in had now become foreign, just because she’d been away for over twelve years.\xa0One day when they were driving on the Mass Pike, Jennifer Parker—Jen to her friends—had found herself in the middle lane, with big SUVs on both sides of their rented Taurus.\xa0“Okay,” her mom said, “that’s it. I know we’ve only been back a few weeks, but they’re going to need to build a bigger country.”\xa0“Mom,” Molly said that day, “you’re going to have to let go on the whole car thing.”\xa0Her mom grinned then, because she was the coolest and always got the joke.\xa0“Did I ever by any chance mention the Volkswagen bug I used to drive around in college?”\xa0And Molly had said, “Oh, no, Mom. Never. Not one single time. No kidding—you used to have a Volkswagen bug in college? It wasn’t fire-engine red by any chance, was it?”\xa0Then they’d both laughed. Because they both always got the joke, even if it was one as old as the one about her old college car.\xa0In the players’ parking lot now, behind the Sports Authority building, leaning against the wheel of his SUV, Molly closed her eyes, picturing her and her mother in the front seat of the rented car that day, waiting to see how that particular snapshot, from the album she carried around her head, was going to affect her.\xa0Nothing today.\xa0Progress, Molly thought.\xa0Or maybe progress had not one stinking thing to do with it, maybe she was just too wired—a Mom word—to focus on anything except what was going to happen next.\xa0Practice had been over for twenty minutes or so. The players had scattered to different points on the court to sign autographs. All the players except the one the kids in the house really wanted: Josh Cameron.\xa0Not just the biggest star on the Celtics, but the biggest star in the NBA, and maybe any sport right now.\xa0One of the young guys who worked for the Celtics had gotten on the microphone and said that because they knew it would be a mob scene if Josh tried to sign something for every boy and girl in the gym, he—Josh—had a surprise for them all. In the lobby waiting for them on the way out, the guy from the Celtics said, everyone in attendance today would be handed a special Josh Cameron goody bag. Inside was an autographed youth basketball, Celtics cap, and a T-shirt from Josh’s summer basketball camp in Maine.\xa0Then Josh Cameron himself, looking a little bigger to Molly than he did on television, maybe because he wasn’t standing next to some seven-foot monster type, took the microphone and personally thanked everybody for coming, said he hoped they’d had a great time, and promised them a great Celtics season.\xa0“Always remember,” he said, “we can’t do it without your support. And I mean you guys.”\xa0“You’re my hero, Josh!” a girl yelled from somewhere in the stands.\xa0He smiled and wagged a finger in her direction, like she’d somehow shouted out the wrong answer.\xa0“No,” he said. “You guys are my heroes.”\xa0He told them to enjoy their goody bags, told them to study real hard when they weren’t rooting their hardest for the Celtics, then left the practice gym.\xa0That was Molly’s cue to beat it out of there, sneaking through a side door she’d scoped out as the other kids were making their way down to the court. She didn’t even bother to go to the lobby and pick up the bag with all the cute stuff inside.\xa0Instead she went straight for where she’d seen Josh Cameron’s black Lincoln Navigator parked. Molly didn’t know anything about cars, not really. But she knew what Josh was driving because he’d won it for being MVP of the NBA Finals five months ago.\xa0Molly knew about the black Lincoln Navigator the way she knew everything there was to know about him by now. Sometimes her buddy Sam would quiz her, out of the blue, no matter what they were doing.\xa0“What kind of watch does he wear?”\xa0“Too easy,” she’d say. “Omega. They use him now instead of the guy who used to play James Bond.”\xa0“Deodorant?”\xa0“Red Zone from Old Spice. C’mon, these aren’t even challenging.”\xa0“Okay, how about this? What’s the name of his new Labrador puppy, the one he just got last week?”\xa0“He got a new puppy last week?”\xa0Sam made a sound like a buzzer going off on one of the game shows he made Molly watch sometimes on the Game Show Network.\xa0“Nah,” Sam said. “I made it up. But I had you going for a minute. You thought I knew something about him that you didn’t.”\xa0“But you didn’t. Know something I didn’t, I mean.”\xa0“But I did. Have you going. Which is enough to make my day, frankly.”\xa0“You’re crazy,” Molly said.\xa0“What does that say about you?” Sam said. “You could have picked anybody to be your friend and picked me.”\xa0“Good point,” she said.\xa0If Molly didn’t know everything important there was to know about Josh Cameron, she was sure she knew more than anybody else. Her mom had called it the joy of Google.\xa0“I’m not big on technology,” her mom would say, and then Molly would slap her forehead and say, “You have got to be kidding, Mom! I never heard that one before, either.”\xa0“But,” her mom would say, ignoring her, “I do feel that life got a lot better when Google became a verb.”\xa0By now Molly Parker had Googled Josh Cameron so many times that she knew his first two Google pages, starting with his own Web site, by heart.\xa0Basically, he was the most famous and best Boston Celtics basketball player since Larry Bird. And the best and flashiest point guard they’d had since Bob Cousy. But most people, Molly had found out in her research, seemed to think Josh Cameron was the basketball equivalent of Tom Brady, the Patriots quarterback who won all the Super Bowls and looked like he should be playing Hilary Duff’s boyfriend in the movies, even if he was waaaaay too old for her.\xa0Basically, Josh Cameron, six feet two, out of the University of Connecticut, winner of four NBA titles in his first nine years in the league, was the biggest and most popular star in sports right now. American sports, anyway. Molly didn’t even try to explain to Sam or any of the other kids she went to school with about the whole David Beckham thing.\xa0He was thirty-one now, about the same age as her mom. It wasn’t Cryptkeeper old, but he was getting up there, even if you couldn’t tell it by the way he was playing. The Celtics had just won again, and he had won another MVP award.\xa0“He’s one of those guys,” Jen Parker told her daughter. “He’ll get old about the same time Peter Pan does.”\xa0Now, after the T rides she had taken to get to the buses and then the walk from the last bus station, which seemed like a lot more than the mile the bus driver had said, she was finally going to meet him.\xa0She had decided it was time.', 'Read more']";7.99;Mike Lupica (Author);"['Books', ""Children's Books"", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life']";"{'Publisher': 'Viking Books for Young Readers; Reprint edition (October 4, 2007)', 'Language': 'English', 'Paperback': '246 pages', 'ISBN 10': '0142409421', 'ISBN 13': '978-0142409428', 'Reading age': '10 years and up', 'Lexile measure': '790L', 'Grade level': '5 and up', 'Item Weight': '8.8 ounces', 'Dimensions': '8.2 x 5.6 x 0.66 inches'}";0142409421

The Fiction Editor, the Novel, and the Novelist;"['From Library Journal', 'This breezy little book illuminates the normally private relationship between author and editor.

I was a raw and gauche assistant that you would not inflict in person on any author, but I was thought of as a good `backroom\' boy--someone at whom you could shove eleven hundred pages of chaos and demand, ""Fix it!"" That was my assignment on a James T. Farrell manuscript. No one had told me the difference between an editor and a rewrite man, so I toiled manically for six weeks, cutting four hundred pages, rearranging sections, rewriting sentences, rendering two hundred straight-narrative pages into scenes because the great man, then in his twilight, had simply forgotten to write dialogue. My boss did not have time to look at what I did in any detail, and the manuscript went straight into copyediting, where it fell under the eye of Frank Riley, veteran checker of scripts. I can see him now: a hundred ten pounds, very pale and gray, riven with tremors, and always seeming to smoke three cigarettes at once. ""This is for you,"" he said, darting into my hand a memo that he had just written my boss. ""In my seventeen years at Doubleday,"" it began, ""I have never seen such a job as young McCormack has . . ."" If I had had the money, I\'d have hired a plane to scatter thousands of copies of the memo over New York. In fact, cross-eyed with pleasure, I promptly lost the thing.', 'Next came the author. Queasy with doubt, I had to bring the galleys to Farrell at his room in the Beaux Arts Hotel. (My boss decided not to show him the postoperative manuscript; the revision was put directly into type.) Farrell sat me down and went to his desk to address his novel. He read exactly six pages. Then he turned to me. This is it, I felt, and I could see the headline: NOTED AUTHOR RUBS OUT SNOT-NOSED TAMPERER. What he said, in his tough-guy Chicago voice, was, ""You\'re good, kid."" Not another word about the book, and he never read more. He spent the rest of the afternoon telling me about the Black Sox scandal.', ""I was young and green, but after an hour's proud elation I saw the moral clear: Except for Frank Riley, no one would ever know what I'd done in my editorial servitude. In this case, not even the author. (And don't think you now know; underlying everything I say is this unsettling fact: For all you can be sure, I too have the sensibility of a bedpan, and I may have driven a graphite stiletto through the heart of Farrell's book. Any editor can summon up some self-congratulatory story.) When working at that second part of their general assignment--the editing of the script--editors are always in the `backroom'. And I agree with Perkins: That's where we should be. I should add that my efforts did not take chaos and turn it into a great book. I never worked harder in my life, but all I managed to do was make it publishable.

Examples include earth (clay), timber, hemp, reed, straw-bale, low-energy bricks and stone. Many of these traditional walling materials have been used successfully for thousands of years and are now enjoying a renaissance, as the foundation for many of the contemporary 'eco-building' methods. A unifying characteristic between these walling materials is that they are all, to a degree, porous. They allow the free passage of moisture into and out of them, and therefore need to 'breathe' to remain healthy. Because of this, they are highly responsive to changes in relative humidity and temperature in the atmosphere. This means that structures made out of these materials will naturally move in response to these differences. All finishes applied to these materials must therefore match the hardness and porosity of the walling substrate below. They must be flexible enough to accommodate natural movements in the building without cracking, and need to have a high degree of vapour permeability to eliminate the potential for trapping moisture within the wall. A case can also be argued for the use of lime- and earth-based plasters, renders and paints (with certain preparatory measures in place) on some of the modern, conventional building materials, such as concrete block and plasterboard. Though their qualities of softness, breathability and flexibility are not essential when used with these conventional materials, lime- and earth-based finishes can bring benefits in the areas of decreased impact on the environment (their production, toxicity and ease of disposal), improved internal air quality, and by improving the look and general 'feel' of the building and the spaces inside."", 'Wall systems', 'This section introduces different walling systems that are compatible with lime and earth-based finishes. It also outlines the suitability of applying the various finishes to different substrates.', 'Earth walls', 'Earth walls can be constructed in many different ways. Building with earth (clay-rich subsoils) is the most ancient of all building methods. Many variations of earth building have been used throughout the world since man began building shelters. Most earth building methods consist of mixing together a clay-rich subsoil with other ingredients. These are most commonly some form of fibre (straw) to provide tensile strength, and aggregates to provide strength and stability to the mix. Most buildings made out of earth must be raised off the ground at least 450 mm (18?), and should have large roof overhangs to protect the walls from rain.', 'Many of the earth building methods are currently enjoying a revival because they provide a sustainable way of building. This is because most forms of building with earth have an incredibly low environmental impact, especially when locally resourced materials and simple techniques are used. Earth building materials can be indefinitely recycled, and biodegrade easily. They have tremendous health benefits, such as temperature and humidity regulation, high thermal mass (they can absorb and store large amounts of heat), good toxin and odour absorption, and excellent sound insulation properties. Some of the earth building variations include:', 'Monolithic earth walls, such as cob, clob, wychert, clom, mud, clat, clay & clunch', ""A load-bearing walling system – an ancient building technique and material that is used throughout the world, with regional variations, such as 'cob' in the southwest of England. It is composed of clay subsoil, aggregate and straw. These ingredients are mixed together with water to produce a homogenous, malleable and sticky material, which is laid in 'lifts' of 300-600 mm (12-24?) in one building session. Once the previous one has hardened, consecutive lifts are laid until full wall height has been reached. The cob is built up without forms or shuttering, but is compressed in place by foot or with a garden fork. It is then trimmed with a sharp spade to maintain a plumb line."", 'Unfired earth blocks, such as adobe, cob block, and clay lump', 'A load-bearing material used throughout the world for thousands of years. This is a system of creating building blocks out of raw clay-rich subsoil, aggregate and sometimes fibre. The material is either moulded in a plastic state into forms, or compressed by machine in a dry state. The blocks are laid in bonded courses, with either a mud or lime mortar, or simply wetted down and bonded through suction if the blocks are made with dry material.', ""Rammed earth & 'pise de terre'"", 'Monolithic earth walls built up between temporary shuttering. A load-bearing material, which is sometimes mixed (slightly moistened) with aggregate, or it can be used in its raw form if the right proportions naturally exist. It is tamped by hand or with a pneumatic tamper, between wood or steel shuttering. The shuttering is moved up until full wall height is reached.', 'Light clay & light straw clay', ""'Leichlem' (pronounced 'lie-klem')"", 'A non-load-bearing walling material. Straw is coated with a clay-rich slip which is compacted between temporary shuttering, set within a timber structure.', 'Wattle & daub', ""A non-load-bearing walling system of tightly woven sticks (usually a green and flexible wood, such as hazel, willow or maple), set within a timber-framed panel. This lattice (the wattle) is then coated with a 'daub' mixture: a thick clay-rich subsoil mixed with chopped straw or hair, and sometimes animal dung for extra weather resistance and durability. This is squeezed into place between the sticks. The daub can either be finished with a limewash or coated in a lime plaster/render for extra protection. It can be used for exterior walls or interior partition walls."", 'All lime- and earth-based finishes are ideally suited for all types of raw earth construction. Cement and synthetic paints must not be used.', 'Straw-bale wall construction', 'Straw-bale wall construction originated in the USA around the end of the nineteenth century. It coincided with the development of baling machines. The straw bales are used like large building blocks, stacked on top of one another in staggered courses. They are usually speared onto pins – often sharp rods of hazel or steel. This ties them into the foundation and provides structural stability for the walls. There are many different methods of building with straw bales, but these can be broadly categorized into (a) load-bearing, where the bales take the full weight of the roof, and (b) non-load-bearing, where the bales are set within a timber structure and used as a wall infill between the posts. As with walls made out of earth, it is essential that the bales are built onto a raised plinth so that they do not come into contact with water. They also require large roof overhangs to direct moisture away from the wall face.', ""Straw-bale construction generally has a very low environmental impact, especially when materials are sourced locally. The use of large amounts of plant materials in buildings has the added advantage of being able to create 'carbon sinks'. This is due to the absorption of CO2 from the atmosphere as the plant grows, and turns this CO2 into oxygen. The more plant material that can be used in building construction, the more potential there is for decreasing the damaging levels of CO2 currently present in the atmosphere. Straw-bale walls are highly breathable and have excellent insulative properties. This gives straw-bale buildings the potential to provide a very healthy living environment. Straw bales are fully biodegradable and will last for hundreds of years if protected with breathable coatings and utilised within a well designed building."", 'Straw-bale walls must be protected from moisture, and need to be sealed to keep out draughts and protect them from hungry animals.', 'Straw is a breathable material, and hence must not be coated with any non-breathable renders, plasters and paints, such as cement and synthetic paints. These could lead to moisture getting trapped in the bales, which will eventually cause them to rot. Lime- and earth-based finishes are ideal. Straw-bale walls that are exposed to extreme conditions, such as on the weather-facing wall, may require additional protection from the elements such as timber cladding.', 'Lath & plaster', ""Lath and plaster is made up of thin, narrow strips of wood which are attached to wood battens, joists or studding and then plastered. This system can be used as an external and internal wall structure when set within a timber frame. It can also be used to create ceilings. Alternatively it can be used as a system on solid walls which are unable to receive plaster/render directly, such as impervious materials or damp substrates. The substrate is battened and then lathed with a suitable air gap for adequate air circulation. The wood laths can be split by hand (riven lath), or mechanically sawn. Straight-grained wood is necessary, and hand-split laths are considered to be stronger. Sweet chestnut, oak and Scots pine are the most suitable woods to use. The laths can vary in size, but the optimum size is 30mm (1¼?) wide, and 5-6mm (¼?) thick, at lengths up to 1500mm (4' 6?). They must be attached with non-ferrous or galvanized nails to prevent rusting."", ""The laths are fixed parallel to each other and spaced at regular intervals of approximately 10mm (3/8?) apart. The vertical wood supports are spaced at 300mm (12?) centres, and break joints are provided every 1012 laths. The ends of the laths must be butted at a distance of approximately 3mm (1/8?) to allow for potential swelling of the wood, as it absorbs moisture from the wet plaster. A well-haired lime mortar (not earth) is then applied onto the lath. The spacings between the laths allow the mortar to squeeze through the gaps, creating a 'hooking' action to attach the mortar solidly in place."", 'Lath and plaster can have a low environmental impact as long as sustainably harvested wood is used, and especially when hand-splitting (riven laths) methods of production are employed. They are non-toxic, breathable and fully biodegradable.', 'Reed mat', ""Reed mat consists of sturdy lengths of reed, bound together with a zinc-coated wire. Reed mat usually comes in rolled bundles of 10 metres (11 yards) in length, 2 metres (6' 6?) high and 8 mm (5/8?) thick. These mats are attached (similar to lath and plaster technique) horizontally onto wood uprights with sturdy staples. They can be used to create internal partition walls and ceilings, and are well suited for creating curved surfaces, due to their flexibility."", 'Reed mat can also be cut into smaller sections (with secateurs or a jigsaw) and used to prepare wall substrates for plastering or rendering. Examples include covering differential materials within a wall, such as lintels and timber uprights, or sections of repair. Reed mat provides a good alternative to lath and plaster as it is more economical, but it does not provide as solid a backing. Reed mats are perfectly suited to receiving lime and earth plaster/renders.', 'Reed mat has a low environmental impact during its production, and is easily biodegraded with the exception of the minimal amounts of zinc-plated wire that binds the reed together. It is also highly breathable.', 'Masonry', 'Masonry buildings are constructed out of individual building units which are laid in and bound together by mortar of varying types. They must always be built up in staggered courses with no vertical joints, in order to tie the wall structure together.', 'Natural stone', 'There are many different types of stone used in building. This is a reflection of the varied geology across the world. Broadly speaking, stones can be categorized into the softer, more permeable stones, such as the sedimentary rocks of limestone and sandstone, and the harder, less permeable stones, such as the igneous rocks of granite, gabbro and basalt. Even within these categories, however, there are regional differences in strength, porosity and weathering between stones of the same type. For example, there are some varieties of hard limestone and sandstone, and some porous, soft granites.', 'Locally sourced, naturally occurring field stone has a low environmental impact, and can be eternally reused as long as suitably soft bedding mortars, such as lime, are used. Soft mortars can be easily chipped off without damaging the stone. The environmental impact of quarried stone depends on the methods of extraction employed, as well as the distance the quarried material is transported. Quarries can also disturb the natural environment.', 'On its own, stone is a poor insulator, but has high thermal mass. It is non-toxic and generally breathable, with the exception of very hard, impervious types. The determining factor for making a decision on which plaster/render is suitable is down to the hardness and porosity of the stone. Softer, more permeable stones will partner well with earth plasters and the weaker building limes, whereas a harder, less permeable stone will be better suited to the stronger, hydraulic building limes. Some less permeable stones will require a priming coat of some sort before they are suitably placed to receive a lime or earth plaster/render. However, the priming coat should not inhibit the vapour permeability of the stone.', 'Fired brick', 'Traditional bricks are made from clay, which is fired at high temperatures. The firing process drives off the water and creates an irreversible chemical reaction such that the clay will not be returned to a plastic state with the addition of water. These bricks remain relatively soft and very permeable. Many modern bricks are made from sand or flint mixed with lime. They are not fired, but are moulded under steam pressure. This method produces a much harder brick, with strength and permeability characteristics more in line with concrete (a reduced permeability).', 'As with stone, traditional porous bricks will work best with the softer, highly breathable finishes of earth and the weaker building limes, whereas modern bricks are more compatible with the stronger, hydraulic limes. They may require a priming coat before receiving a first coat of lime plaster/render. Producing bricks is a very energy-intensive process (especially modern bricks), but they can be recycled many times over as long as a soft lime bedding material is used. Bricks will also last for a very long time if laid and finished with suitable mortars, such as lime or earth.', 'Fired clay honeycomb insulating blocks', 'These consist of a fired clay block with a honeycomb cross-section. They are suitable for use for both external and internal load-bearing walls, and have been widely used on the continent for many years. The honeycomb structure of the block means that it is only necessary to create a single skin, because the block itself provides excellent insulation properties. They can replace conventional cavity wall construction. Mortar is only necessary for the horizontal joint, due to a tongue-and-groove vertical edge which locks the abutting blocks firmly together. They are ideally suited for use with earth and lime mortars and finishes, and make highly breathable buildings.', 'Concrete block', 'In their most basic form, concrete blocks consists of cement, sand and aggregates. Concrete blocks are relatively cheap to produce, and are one of the most widely used construction materials for external walls in the UK and throughout most of the world. Other types of concrete block include lightweight concrete blocks, such as breeze block. There are also aerated concrete blocks, which are made from cement, sand and lime. They both have better insulating qualities than the standard blocks. Concrete can also be cast on site in shuttering. Cement finishes are most commonly used with concrete materials, but earth and lime finishes can be used, with suitable preparatory measures, to enhance the look, feel and internal air quality of a building.', 'Concrete blocks are not appropriate for use in any type of conservation or restoration work involving traditional buildings. This is because they are hard and impermeable, and will move differently from the traditional materials.', 'All concrete materials are very energy-intensive in their production, and are often transported long distances. Using concrete blocks made with secondary aggregates will go some way to reducing this impact. Concrete blocks can be recycled, or crushed up to be used as infill or road base. However, many of the additives used to make cement are potentially toxic and damaging to human health and the environment.', '(Continues...)', 'Excerpted from', 'Clay & Lime Renders Plasters & Paints', 'by', 'Adam Weismann, Katy Bryce', '.

I resisted the urge to tell her the images in the booklet were almost as unrealistic and unattainable as the ones in the Victoria’s Secret catalog. Why burst her bubble? Optimism was a critical ingredient in any garden.', 'Babe had specically requested yellow because that color would work with the diner’s new hot-pink shutters. Not exactly ye olde New England color scheme found in regional magazines, which always wanted to call red, Betsy Ross red, and blue, Heritage blue, as if the building’s occupants all wore knee breeches and white hose and were called Lemuel or Goody. But Babe was not your garden-variety New Englander and the colors worked for her—a little punk rocker, a little Caribbe an beachcomber—to go with the lakeside setting and the tiki-bar feel of the place.', '“Damn,” she said.', 'What now? She stood at the far side of her outdoor café, looking perturbed.

I should have read the telltale signs— the tag sale, the rented Dumpster, the “Oh, no, we’re just doing some fall cleaning.” Right, and I’m just doing this because I’m a madcap heiress waiting for my inheritance to come through.', 'The good news was that those two miscreants inspired my latest professional brainstorm—the quickie curb-appeal face- lift. Makeup for your home. With all the', 'for sale', 'signs dotting the area, these instant-gratication jobs had turned into the most lucrative and least-labor- intensive part of my business. I suppose I had cable television to thank.', 'For three to ve hundred bucks, depending on the size and selling price of the house, I’d sweep in with a horticultural Band-Aid for a plain house—containers, annuals, and a few small trees. Pumpkins and ornamental kale in the fall. Just about the only thing I couldn’t orchestrate was a thin wisp of smoke emanating from the chimney to give it that nal Norman Rockwell touch.', 'If you lived here you’d be happy, warm. Your\xa0 house would be lled with the smell of homemade bread or apple pie. Your kids\xa0 wouldn’t smoke pot or give you a hard time. And all your in- laws would be people you’d actually hang out with if you had a choice.', 'All courtesy of a few plants, a vivid imagination, and a fondness for Norman Rockwell.', 'At the Paradise, on the other hand, that wasn’t required. Not that Babe had anything against Norman Rockwell, but she saw my work at the diner as a calling card—not unlike the display gardens at a ower show. Babe had insisted I put Designed by Dirty Business signs on the planters as a way to drum up business. It had worked for the past three seasons, and I had my\xa0 ngers crossed for next year.', 'I allowed myself to think about a vacation. I hadn’t had one since leaving my old job, but once my assets and debits were on speaking terms I was heading to Jost Van Dyke. I’d lie in a hammock and read the water-swollen paperbacks—thoughtfully left by previous travelers— that smelled of the sea and suntan lotion. And the biggest decision I’d have to make was which high-calorie local drink to order, the painkiller or the bushwhacker.', 'In the meantime the Paradise Diner would serve as my Caribbean surrogate. Earlier in the season, Hugo Jurado and I had turned one corner of Babe’s parking lot into an outdoor café, something sorely missing in suburban Springeld. Hugo was Anna’s husband and my part-time helper; sometimes it seemed as if they were the brains of the business and I worked for them instead of the other way around.', 'Springeld’s downtown had evolved, even in just the few years since I’d arrived. We had an art house movie theater and an all-night deli, but further out of town Babe’s and the Dunkin’ Donuts were the only two gastronomic and social destinations. Double D had the edge on the coffee, but no one could touch the donuts at the Paradise.', 'Hugo and I had constructed wooden\xa0 ower boxes two feet high and four feet deep creating a modular enclosure for a twenty-by-twenty-foot area in the front of the diner. In the spring and summer the boxes dripped with colorful annuals and perennials, and Babe wanted to extend the season with a fall display that included shrubs and ornamental grasses. All of them were a charming counterpoint to Babe’s deliciously trashy message marquee and neon sign, where one of the bulbs was always burned out or smashed. I half suspected that kids came by at night when the diner was closed and tossed rocks at the lightbulbs, to help Babe maintain the diner’s slightly seedy look, or maybe it was Babe herself, who knew?', 'She had added picnic tables and unmatched tag-sale umbrellas, so now in addition to being a must stop for every trucker in this part of the state, the shabby chic café was attracting the Main Street Moms who had previously been too timid or too snobby to venture in, preferring the overpriced gourmet bakery three towns away.', 'One or two curmudgeonly regulars had grumbled that Babe was tarting up the place, but just as many appreciated the new and better-looking faces. The early shift of day laborers and long haulers who camped out at Babe’s—whether they were hungry or not—was now followed by clusters of suburban matrons, sometimes with their kids, fresh from soccer or ballet or dressage. Sometimes they overlapped.', '“When you pay my bills,” she told the complainers, “you can tell me how to decorate and who to serve.”', 'I didn’t pay her bills either, and she rarely paid mine, except for materials. For the most part, Babe and I had an in-kind arrangement. I worked on her outside space and she let me use a corner booth at the Paradise as an informal ofce where the coffee kept owing and Pete number two (so named to distinguish him from Babe’s late husband) used me as a guinea pig for new recipes. It was an arrangement that suited me\xa0 ne despite the three or four pounds I’d put on since I had relocated to Springeld from New York City and our unspoken agreement had started. And Babe’s bulletin board was my private ad space, touting my services to residents and small businesses up and down the Merritt Parkway, which brought Babe many of her non-truck-driving customers.', 'This was a far cry from Babe’s previous life twenty or so years earlier when she was a backup singer traveling with a band and the dear departed Pete number one. Late in the day when there were no kids around, she would let slip one of her more outrageous anecdotes, and she never failed to gather a crowd at the diner’s counter, leaving most of her listeners feeling Walter Mittyish for living vicariously through her adventures instead of getting off their butts and having some of their own. Once in a while a story sounded suspiciously like something I’d seen in a movie or read in a novel, but if she was embellishing, who cared? Who didn’t relive the past and burnish some stories to make herself seem smarter, hipper, and funnier? And she told the stories well, with enough brio and detail to make you feel as if you’d been there with her, partying with rock stars and dancing on yachts.', '“I miss it sometimes,” she’d said, “traveling with the Jimmy Collins Band. A different city every week. Hell, sometimes every night. That was a lifetime ago. I have no complaints. Somebody once told me there are only two stories: a man goes on a journey, and a stranger comes to town. The rst half of my life, I went on the journey. Now I’m here and the people who come to the diner are the ones who come to town.” A bittersweet smile had crossed her face when she said it, and I wondered if she was thinking about Pete number one and how they had come to this town so many years ago.', 'Babe brushed her hands on her tight black jeans, held the diner’s screen door open, and shooed me inside. “C’mon, Linnaeus,” she said. Babe was a quick study.', '“Town” was Springeld, Connecticut, somewhere between Boston and New York and light-years from both. I had come to Spring eld from New York City years earlier as a summer renter, thinking everything was so much smaller and simpler than my life in New York. People said hello. After only two trips to the diner I was asked if I was having “the usual.”', 'Arrogantly, I found everything', 'quaint', '. Then a few years back I lost my job and my boyfriend in one sixty-day period. I came here to lick my wounds and I never left. Small and simple was just what I needed.', '“Speaking of a man going on a journey, have you heard from Neil?” I asked casually, sliding onto a counter stool and positioning my backpack on the one next to it. I peeled off my garden gloves, shoved them into a back pocket, and checked out the day’s specials on the blackboard. I made an extra effort to appear to be studying the menu in case the subject of her relationship with Neil was off-limits.', 'Babe’s face softened. Neil was her sweet young thing. He had gone home to Scotland because his mother was ill and wound up staying longer than any of them had expected. “He’s supposed to be back in two weeks, according to the last round of electronic missives.”', 'Neil had been e-mailing and Twittering lists of movies, foods, and recreational activities he expected to indulge in once he got home. They were sweet, like two teenagers separated during summer vacation. Babe smacked her lips as if Neil were one of Pete number two’s architectural, Food Network desserts. “His mom is out of the woods medically, but it sounds like she didn’t change a lightbulb or hang a picture in the seven years he’s been in this country. You’d think no one else in Scotland knew how to use a spanner. That’s a wrench . . .\xa0 or a hammer. I forget which.”', '“C’mon, isn’t it just the mom thing? Don’t you have it have with your kids?”', '“My kids? They’ve been independent from a very early age.”', 'That’s right. I recalled one of Babe’s late-night storytelling sessions. She told us how one night her sons, Dylan and Daltry, had borrowed a friend’s car to catch Hootie & the Blowsh at a club called Emerald City, more than a hundred miles away. They almost made it, when a couple of bored staties pulled them over on the Jersey Turnpike for driving with a broken taillight. Her sons were eleven and thirteen at the time and the only thing that bothered Babe was that they’d done it all to see Hootie and not some edgier, hipper band.', 'Independent', 'was an understatement. So independent that I’d never met them and neither had anyone at the diner. They hadn’t been back east since their father had died. That was a subject I didn’t touch. People\xa0 were funny when it came to their kids.', 'I placed my order—red, white, and blueberry wafes, probably the reason for my extra four pounds—and went to wash my hands. When I got back, Babe was peering out the window through the miniblinds.', '“What have we here?” she said under her breath. “If it’s Tuesday it must be . . .\xa0 what, horseback riding or lacrosse? Convoy of Main Street Moms arriving, Pete. Crank up the cappuccino machine.” Which was a joke, since she didn’t own a cappuccino machine, although Pete was lobbying hard for one, as well as a copper milk steamer he’d seen on QVC.', 'I half stood in my seat to see what was holding her attention for so long. A otilla of sleek cars had arrived and pulled into the angled parking spots adjacent to the entrance as if they were a team of synchronized swimmers or trained seals. Just as gracefully, out the drivers came,\xa0 rst one smooth fair head, then the next.', 'All the moms wore slightly different permutations of the same early fall outt—turtlenecks, leather vests, quilted jackets, quilted vests, leather jackets, with well-coordinated gloves, scarves, and bags that were like the colors on creamy decorator paint chips. Pricey paint.', 'Four or\xa0 ve kids who could have belonged to any of the women piled out of the back of the largest SUV. Towheaded angels, a cross between the psycho kids from', 'Village of the Damned', 'and those from the latest Ralph Lauren ad campaign whose little duds probably cost more than my rst car, although that wasn’t saying much. Something about the mothers suggested they had just parked Thoroughbred\xa0 horses, like their cars, on similar angles, and left them in the nearby Mossdale Stables.', 'Caroline Sturgis was the last to dismount from a silver, or maybe it was a Paul Revere pewter Land Rover. Caroline was one of my\xa0 rst customers in Springeld. We’d met at a local thrift shop—I was buying, she was donating. Despite the differences in our ages and socioeconomic groups, she seemed to gravitate toward me. As a newcomer with a business, I needed all the contacts I could get, so I responded.', 'This would be the third year I’d looked after Caroline’s property, weaning her from the pedestrian triumvirate of impatiens, marigold, and red salvia and steering her toward more adventurous plantings, or at least my notion of them. But I’d kept my distance for the last month or so because making a house call inevitably involved a pitcher of something alcoholic. I’d succumbed in the past and it resulted in my losing a day’s work and once, a dozen ats of pansies that had sat wilting in the sun for hours while Caroline and I got very happy on a bottle of Mouton Rothschild. Getting loaded early in the day was something a\xa0rich suburban matron might be able to do, but it was a no-no for a woman of modest means who was struggling to keep her small business a oat.', 'It was just cool enough to turn up your collar without looking too affected, so Caroline and the Moms settled in at a table outside—one farthest from the road, mostly out of the sun, and at an appropriate distance from another table of women whom they acknowledged but didn’t join. Their kids commandeered a picnic table nearby.', 'These were the well-heeled ladies of Springeld and its neighboring towns. They traveled in packs to book groups and charity events, prep school fund-raisers and the occasional local art show or dramatic per-for mance. They were attractive, polite, and just standof sh enough to make you feel justi ed in not feeling all warm and fuzzy toward them. If there was a Junior League in Connecticut I wasn’t aware of it, but I imagined that the Main Street Moms—as Babe had christened them— were the unofcial New England equivalent. I had a love-hate relationship with them. Two or three more on my client list and I could stop worrying about the rising cost of mulch and start packing for the Virgin Islands, but with a last shred of inde pendence, self-respect, or city slicker stupidity—I didn’t know which— I couldn’t bring myself to suck up to them the way any other small businesswoman would have.', 'Babe motioned for one of her young waitresses to go outside and take their orders.', '“Why me?” the girl said, her expression changing from sullen to stricken. “They always look at me as if I have two heads.” She didn’t. She had one head, but she did have more than the requisite seven holes in it. Thank goodness my generation was satised with a few extra holes in our earlobes.', '“Hey, Terry, you don’t wanna be looked at, lose the nose ring and the eyebrow bolts. Otherwise wear your freak\xa0 ag proudly,” Babe said, sympathetic but rm. She swished a handful of menus under the girl’s pierced nose.', '“Great. Now I’m going to have to google', 'freak ag', '. I don’t know what that means, but I’m going,” the girl said, shaking her head. She snatched the menus and let the screen door slam as she went out, but her chin was the tiniest bit higher than it been earlier, getting the spirit of the advice if not the actual reference.', '“Good girl!” Babe said.', '“What', 'does', 'that mean?” I asked quietly.', '“Et tu, Paula? You girls are sadly lacking in a basic cultural education,” Babe said. “I told them to write down everything they heard in the diner that they didn’t understand and then look it up. Freak\xa0 ag? Woodstock? The Dead? Frank Zappa? Crosby, Stills and Nash? What are you girls going to listen to when you get old, sitting in that rocking chair on the nursing home porch? The Spice Girls? Salt-N-Pepa?”', 'Outside, shielding her eyes, Caroline Sturgis twisted in her seat and peered through the miniblinds until she located me at the counter. She wiggled her ngers in my direction, said something to her friends, then excused herself and headed for the front door. I knew I should have parked the Jeep farther in the rear, she might not have known I was there.', '“Hello, partner,” she sang, accompanied by the screen door’s bells. She walked in my direction with just the hint of a cowboy swagger.', '“That’s premature,” I said. “I\xa0 haven’t agreed to anything.”', 'For months Caroline had been pursuing me. She wanted us to start a business together, but I wasn’t sold on the idea. I worried there would be lots of celebrating and not a lot of working.', 'She', 'might be able to write off a failed business as this year’s uncompleted pet project, like a quilt or an exercise program, but I couldn’t. Besides, I didn’t like partners and hadn’t had one for a while. Professional or otherwise. Having been thrown recently, I was\xa0 nding it hard to get back on the\xa0 horse.', '“You’ve been avoiding me,” Caroline said, wagging a\xa0 nger at me. “I know it.”', 'Of course she knew it. I was the worst liar on the planet. That’s how my mother always knew when I stayed out too late or sneaked beers and cigarettes with my girlfriends and then tried to mask the smell with Altoids. That’s why I’d had a string of two- date relationships. What’s the point? If it’s not happening, it’s not happening. And that was why it was a good thing I was no longer in the television business, where lying was practically a job requirement.', '“This is not just a bored housewife’s fantasy,” Caroline said. She’d read my mind.', '“I’ve written a business plan. I have spreadsheets and everything, and I’m going to sit here until you agree to meet with me to discuss it.”', 'That last line was delivered with all the certainty of a three-year-old who announces that he’s going to hold his breath until you do something, knowing full well that you’re not going to let him turn himself blue, even if he could.', 'Caroline had unwittingly just listed everything I hated. I came to Springeld to get away from spreadsheets and business plans. I was hardly going to be lured back into harness by a pie chart. And I’d gotten used to being the boss. Okay, my full-time staff was sitting on this counter stool, but at least I didn’t think my boss was an idiot, as most people do.', 'Still, I liked Caroline. What started as a business relationship had developed into something more—a friendship not based on history and “remember when.” And it wasn’t as if I had any burning plans for the next few months other than keeping this counter seat warm and keeping Babe company. I’d briey considered an off-season job but didn’t really see myself plowing people’s driveways, which was what most of the other gardeners did during winter.', 'Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad getting toasted before noon during those long, cold months between November and February when business was slow or, let’s face it, nonexistent. Caroline drank the good stuff, too, no screw-top bottles for her. I could resurrect my fondness for Veuve Clicquot and premium vodka on her dime, instead of indulging in the Two Buck Chuck I’d been sipping and pretending to like on those chilly evenings alone by the\xa0 re.', 'I was driving into the city the next day, picking up my pal Lucy, and heading to Bucks County for an old colleague’s wedding. Now that nuptials lasted ve days and required interstate, if not intercontinental, travel I wasn’t likely to be back in Connecticut for almost a week, especially if I tacked on a few days visit with Lucy.', '“When were you thinking of getting together?” I asked, taking out my phone and scrolling through the calendar.', '“I knew it! I knew you’d say yes!” Caroline said. “We’re going to buy Chiaramonte’s!”', '“I', 'haven’t', 'said yes. I agree to talk about it when I get back and perhaps advise you, that’s all.”', 'Caroline nodded, not hearing me. Why are blond women always so sure we’re going to do what they want? And why do we do it? I was sure it had something to do with the vestigial scars from high school. We’re still hoping the cool kids will want to have lunch with us. How pathetic is that?', 'She pulled out an old-style planner, blood-red leather, with her initials stamped in gold on the front. All the pages still had hard edges, and there were no stray papers or business cards sticking out. Brand-new for her brand-new venture. It was endearing. She ipped through a few pages with a fat ceramic pen.', '“I can’t do next week, either—college visits. Jason’s only fourteen, but that’s when you have to start looking. He’s had a wish list since he was nine. How about the following week? I told Sarah I’d go with her to the doctor’s, but I don’t know which day yet. She’ll need my support,” she said, almost to herself. “She’s getting Brandon’s DNA results back to see which sports he’ll be good at.”', 'I wracked my brain trying to think which of the little blond urchins was Brandon. “Isn’t he just a toddler?”', '“That’s when you’re supposed to do it, or else Sarah might waste a lot of time taking him to the wrong classes.”', 'That’s right, heaven forbid Brandon spends time at an activity for which he is not genetically predisposed.', '“How about meeting on the twelfth, nine a.m. at my place unless I let you know otherwise? Does that work for you?” Caroline asked. “I’ll come straight home from my morning\xa0 ride.”', 'It did indeed. In the fall, almost everything worked for me, especially when someone asked that far in advance. It was the time of year when I remembered the concept of weekends, too. And exercise that involved colorful weights instead of forty-pound bags of topsoil or manure.', 'In any event, our scheduled appointment gave me enough time to gure out how to let Caroline down gently when I eventually said no. It was a hundred to one I’d actually want to go in to business with her, but why blow her off completely; no point in totally burning bridges or alienating my biggest customer.', 'Mission accomplished, Caroline left to rejoin her pals outside, chirping to Babe on her way out to think of a good name for our new gardening venture.', 'Babe and I answered at the same time, “What’s wrong with Dirty Business?”', 'Caroline laughed like a teenager. “', 'Dirty Business', '— that', 'is', 'a good name, better than Chiaramonte’s. Done!” She snaked through a knot of recent arrivals and tried unsuccessfully to ignore the comments of a handful of truckers waiting to be seated. She smiled but sidestepped them, backing up against the Snapple fridge, as if coming too close would somehow contaminate her or rough up the nap of her tan suede jacket. It was all very faux friendly.', 'In the group was one long-haired, bearded guy, not bad looking if you liked that slightly grungy Johnny-Damon-when-he-was- a-Red-Sox look. He wore Oakley sunglasses, a dark green windbreaker, and a baseball cap with an ornate letter D on the crown.', 'He took off the glasses to get a better look at Caroline or perhaps to give her a better look at him—I couldn’t tell which. Neither Babe nor I heard the exchange, but from Caroline’s reaction something he said shook her up. She rushed out the door, and Babe shrugged as if to say, “what the hell?” Caroline must have made some excuse to her friends because without even touching her coffee she left a few dollars on the table and hurried to her car. “Johnny Damon” walked to the door and put his hand on the handle as if he was going to go after her.', '“What did I tell you boys about scaring the locals?” Babe said it loudly enough to stop him in his tracks. He turned around and smiled. “Do you know what the markup is on coffee and a fat-free muf n versus the lumberjack specials and endless cups of coffee you animals are gonna suck down?” Babe might not have looked like much of a businesswoman, but she knew where every penny went and where it had come from. Anna and I could take a page from her book.', '“I didn’t mean nothing, honest,” he said, walking back to the counter. “I just said she looked familiar. You look familiar, too, pretty lady,” he said. “Can I buy you a coffee?”', '“That’s highly original. Are you, by any chance recently divorced? Because I don’t think I’ve heard that one since leg warmers were in style. Next time, you could try asking what her sign is. I hear that one’s making a comeback, too.”', 'She was busting his chops but in a gentle, irty way, smiling and leaning over the counter. Few people left Babe’s without wanting to be either her friend or her lover. This one was a toss-up.', 'One of his pals chimed in. “Give him a break, Babe. It’s his rst time\xa0 here. JW don’t know the rules.”', 'What were the rules, anyway? Were they posted somewhere? Did I know them? The man looked sheepish and said nothing, rejoining his friends. His buddies laughed; then they all piled into a booth closest to the front door before the table was even bussed. One of Babe’s singing waitresses went to clean it up and take their orders.', '“Not bad,” Babe whispered, advance scouting for me as usual.', 'I ignored her. One of', 'my', 'rules is not to think of someone as a potential mate or date until I’ve at least said a complete sentence to him and gotten a semi-intelligent answer.', '“I’ve thrown back better. How’s the new help working out?” I asked, changing the subject. The help was three girls who had stumbled in, in tears, after a singing gig that hadn’t gone well. Of course Babe had hired them on the spot and promised to help them with their act. Now they worshipped her and copied her every move.', '“That’s a very slick segue. They’re not so new anymore. But they’re doing okay, thanks for asking. They’ve got more physical presence on-stage,” she said, holding the ketchup bottle like a mike and pretending to sing into it. “They’ll be at Ringwald’s in a coupla weeks. Alba’s singing lead.”', 'They all looked the same to me. Alba must have been the one inside—more condence than the one with the multiple piercings. She was holding her own, sparring with a table full of burly guys; no mean feat for a ninety-pound teenager in heavy makeup and black Frankenstein shoes that looked like cinder blocks, spray painted and strapped to her heronlike legs. Her life ashed before my eyes. I saw her strutting her stuff, sucking on a ball microphone and posturing like Madonna or Mick or Avril or Amy, getting deliriously famous and then crashing and burning before she was twenty-one, rehab by twenty-two—video at eleven. Perhaps I took too dim a view of the music business.', 'The girl outside, with the eyebrow bolt, was more introspective. Probably the songwriter, writing a lot of angry chick, why-did-you-dump-me songs. Jeez, I was turning into a cranky broad. Was I really jealous of a couple of young girls?', '“You should go,” Babe said, as if she\xa0 were clairvoyant.', '“Lots of guys at Ringwald’s.”', '“Twenty- year- olds.”', '“Nothing wrong with young stuff for whatever ails you.”', 'That was as aggressive as Babe got in her matchmaking efforts. A few times a week she remembered that I hadn’t had a date in a while and gave it a shot, but she never pressed.', 'Sometimes it seemed as if she and Lucy Cavanaugh, my friend the bridesmaid, were having a private contest to see who could hook me up rst. Despite Lucy’s vehement denials, I knew there’d be a x-up sometime over the course of the upcoming ve-day wedding. That was the real reason she’d asked me to drive her. And while I wasn’t actively dreading it, I\xa0 wasn’t looking forward to it either.', '“I’m going to a wedding. There will be ample opportunity for me to listen to some boring guy’s whole life story before telling him I’m not interested. Besides, as you say, plenty of cute guys right here. No need for me to pay a cover charge for some watered-down drinks at some shabby joint downtown. I can just stay in this shabby joint and watch the passing parade.”', '“Shabby? I’m cutting you off. Pete, no more taste testing for Paula,” she yelled.', 'Moments later, Eyebrow Girl pushed through the door, butt\xa0 rst, muttering, with two trays of cups and small plates, one of them precariously balanced on her forearm. Something on her sleeve, or maybe her studded leather cuff, snagged on the door handle and one of the trays ew out of her hands like an oversized Frisbee. The other one fell with a clatter, splashing beverages up in the air like minigeysers.', '“Holy shit!” she said, laughing and only half covering her mouth, in deference to the father sitting at the counter, who gave her a disapproving look and covered his toddler’s ears as if the kid could recognize a naughty word at that tender age.', 'No one was hurt and just a few were splattered by the mug puddles; someone applauded. I’ve never quite understood that. Is that supposed to make the person feel better?', 'Yes, I am a klutz and a loser, thank you for acknowledging. I feel so much better.', 'The bearded trucker who’d spoken to Caroline was closest to the door, and he got up to help the girl who was crab walking in a circle collecting the items she’d dropped. He said something to her, and it was the rst time I’d ever seen the kid crack a smile, although she went to some pains to hide it.', 'Babe came around from behind the counter and picked up the cups and plates that had traveled farthest. “All right, Mr. Nice Guy, you’ve redeemed yourself for your formerly boorish behavior. Go eat your food before it gets cold. I’ll get this.”', '“Don’t worry, Terry, it’s no big deal,” she whispered, bending down to help the girl. “Doesn’t really count unless you send one of them to the emergency room.” She handed the girl a soggy ve-dollar bill. “Take your tip and go wash your hands.” Babe brought the mess back to the counter near where I was sitting with my coffee and waiting for my order.', '“Look at this. Pete makes these phenomenal, food orgasm muf ns and the Moms barely touch them. They don’t need utensils, they need scalpels.”', 'The cranberries had been picked off and a thin layer of crust was almost surgically shaved off the tops. I remembered that calorie reduction tip well.', '“', 'You', 'used to be like that,” she said. “A damn picky eater. Before you got some sense.”', 'Sense. To Babe that meant ordering the wafes. Or the cake or the sundae or whatever it was you really wanted. Whether it was food, men, or adventures, Babe did not believe in living a life of denial.', '“These women,” she said, motioning to the group outside. “I still don’t get some of them.” She cleared off the tray and put the cups and dishes in a rubber basin underneath the counter.', '“So what is it the queen of the cul-de-sacs wants you to do now? Plant marigolds in the shape of clinking martini glasses?” Babe was referring to my rst fall in Springeld when Caroline had asked for tulips planted in the shape of giant crossed tennis rackets. Which worked out well until, inevitably, they opped over and resembled nothing more than an enormous handlebar mustache.', '“That’s very creative,” I said. “I may offer that next year. I could do martini glasses. Champagne utes should go over well during bridal season.” I was semiserious.', '“You remember last spring when Caroline was calling me three times a day,” I said, “and practically stalking me here at the diner?” Babe nodded.', '“She’s got some notion to buy Guido Chiaramonte’s old nursery. And she’s written a business plan, which I have foolishly agreed to take a look at. She’d have a garden gift shop and I’d offer design services. We’d col', 'laborate on special projects.”', '“Sounds good. What’s wrong with that?”', '“They want two million dollars for the property, and it probably needs another ve hundred thousand just to open the doors. She wants to front the money and put it all in my name.”', 'That raised an eyebrow. She looked around as if to appraise her own lot with its charming waterfront view. What was her lakeside property worth? One million? More? “Okay. Unusual but, I repeat, what’s wrong with that?”', 'I couldn’t put my nger on it, but in my gut there was something about Caroline’s plan that didn’t sit right with me. It was too good to be true, like those Nigerian e-mail scams—', 'just send me the postage, my friend, and we will split a fortune.', 'My knee-jerk reaction was to say no. But that was generally my knee-jerk reaction to things— not unlike the overcautious lawyer who says, “We could have a problem there. . . .” There is no problem, but there could be one.', 'That was also the reason I owned a ten-year-old car, a fteen-yearold television, and a four-year- old cell phone that the company’s Web site refers to as a “legendary” model. It took me awhile to say yes to new things.', '“C’mon, what’s the downside?” Babe said. “I mean, not to put too\xa0 ne a point on it, but she’s loaded and you’ve got two, maybe three nickels to rub together.”', 'And where does', 'that', 'expression come from? Why would anyone want to rub two nickels together? Are they supposed to make babies if you rub them together? From anyone else, I would have been offended, but Babe was close to the truth. I was fantasizing about an island trip, but I was treading water nancially. It happened every year at this time. I sucked it up, ate big breakfasts— the least expensive and most lling meal of the day and frequently free, if Pete had gotten a new cookbook or watched a new cooking program.

Robust and proven strategies are discussed with case studies, allowing the reader to gain a better insight into how the strategies can be implemented pragmatically.This book is beneficial to both novices and those at an advanced level as the tools presented, such as causal layered analysis, help readers become better systematic thinkers. Readers will learn how they can identify and influence their organization in any given situation, enabling them to make better decisions with regards to shaping the future.This is a worthy book, packed with modern skills that can be practiced by any leader who would like to master strategic foresight and face the future with certainty. --Suresh Suprarnamian, in Quality World, June 2017Patricia Lustig has woven a fascinating tapestry of diverse resources to create an integrated framework for practicing strategic foresight. The author...presents a 10-point logic of the futures toolbox to help any individual or organisation dynamically practice strategic foresight....The strategic foresight toolkit also includes a checklist of questions to sharpen the thinking process to identify and envision the envisioned future.There are several case studies in the book that clearly describe how to learn from the future and engage in change.

Bullet in the Night;"['About the Author', ""Judith Rolfs minored in English and creative writing at college but her major focus became psychology and ultimately marriage and family counseling. Her first article was published in Fresh Ink magazine while a student at Marquette University. At her first writer's conference her novel proposal won the Best New Novel Award.

She learned to listen for the meaning behind words and tries to convey emotional depth in her characters. Writing Bullet in the Night from the perspective of her own and her heroine s counseling profession lets her share insights with readers who may never enter a professional counselor's office. Rolfs says, I value the opportunity to contribute a word or two of wisdom: life is hard, people can be evil, but God is good, and all the time.

He can eat an entire pizza in under five minutes, but he'll have to train to do better than that and win the competition.

Mr. Bow Tie;"['From Publishers Weekly', ""Mr. Bow Tie is homeless. Come rain or shine the colorfully clothed gentleman lives on the street outside a small grocery store. As told by the boy whose parents own the store, Barbour's ( Nancy ; Little Nino's Pizzeria ) picture book presents the social phenomenon of homelessness in uncomplicated prose and bold artwork, painting a very real picture of a bustling city neighborhood. Amid the hubbub, Mr. Bow Tie is befriended. He helps out at the store and finally--through the efforts of the narrator's family--is reunited with his aging parents. While in keeping with her sunny illustrations and upbeat text, Barbour's unlikely happy ending is off-putting in its relentless cheeriness. Her efforts in bringing this pressing problem to children's attention are commendable; the book's unrealistic resolution, however, ultimately undermines these good intentions. In sobering contrast to a somewhat misleading portrayal are the statistics on homelessness--and a contact address--that appear on the book's back flap. A more clear-eyed--and ultimately heartwarming--treatment of this topic can be found in last season's Uncle Willie and the Soup Kitchen by DyAnne DiSalvo-Ryan. Ages 4-8. Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc."", 'From School Library Journal', 'Grade 1-4-- Something of an urban fairy tale for the \'90s, based on a true story. Mr. Bow Tie, who does not speak, is befriended and fed by a storekeeper and his family, who reunite the man with his parents. The child\'s first-person narration is brief (one or two sentences per page), and the story is plainly told, but it is graceful in its spare simplicity, and conveys a great deal of information. Much of it will require explanation, however, such as the phrase ""decorated war hero."" The bold, bright watercolor and gouache folk-art paintings depict a crowded cityscape chockablock with people, movement, and color; Mr. Bow Tie is shown as a nonthreatening eccentric. The illustrations do not belie the gravity of the subject, nor are they at odds with the story\'s hopeful intent. This is a gentle, humane introduction to homelessness. Two caveats: readers may notice that Mr. Bow Tie looks implausibly clean throughout, and that his many costumes make him look like a clown. Secondly, the story\'s happy ending is seldom realized in life. This book stands in contrast to Bunting\'s affecting Fly Away Home (Clarion, 1991); it is more optimistic and less somber. Teachers and librarians who wish to address this complex social issue will want to own both books, and perhaps use them together. --Kate McClelland, Perrot Memorial Library, Greenwich, CTCopyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.', 'From Kirkus Reviews', ""Two kids tell how their dad's gift of a meal to the homeless man who sleeps outside their neighborhood store leads first to an informal exchange of his help (sweeping the sidewalk, etc.) for more food and eventually to his going happily away with his parents, contacted through ``a big office.''

The Book of Trouble: A Romance;"['From Publishers Weekly', 'Before Afghanistan became front-page news and then a travel destination for adventurers, Marlowe (', 'How to Stop Time: Heroin from A to Z', ') ""dreamed about going there."" After missing the chance as a 20-year-old exploring Europe (she got as close as Istanbul), she had to wait 25 years. During that time, the author, a writer and legal headhunter, bought a Manhattan townhouse, traveled to other Third World countries, survived heroin addiction and enjoyed a lively sex life as a single woman. She finally trekked to Afghanistan in 2002, where she found the ""kindness and tenderness"" she lacked in New York and, although she\'s Jewish, felt ""more at home than I had in Israel, and more loved."" The book\'s subtitle refers to the author\'s failed affair with an Afghan man 10 years her junior, but the memoir is equally a valentine for the Islamic world. Marlowe meets Amir, a Muslim engineer, shortly before her second trip to Afghanistan; between chapters about her passionate times with him, she writes fondly about her host family in the northern city of Mazar, where she teaches English. Though a graceful writer, Marlowe has trouble integrating the stories of her two passions. Still, her honest meditations on love and family make this a satisfying read.', '(Feb.)', 'Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And then, over risotto with fall vegetables, he tells the other guests what he wants: ""A seventeen-year-old virgin."" They are horrified, especially when, a couple of months later, Marlowe begins an affair with him. Marlowe\'s second memoir\x97the first was about her time as a heroin user\x97candidly recounts her fascination with Afghanistan and the hungry, hopeless, clumsy progress of the affair. At times, her fetishizing of Amir\'s rugged build and exotic heritage inclines one to sympathy with her disapproving friends, but her sharp intellect rescues this faltering romantic narrative, and she provides an incisive and refreshing comparison of Afghan and Western social mores.

Normally I love parties, but that night I found the effort to make small talk exhausting. I told the host that I was leaving, although it was barely midnight.\xa0“Wait, you should meet Amir; he’s from Afghanistan. Meet Ann, she just got back from Mazar-i-Sharif last week.”\xa0A powerfully built man with thick black hair, a hooked nose, and skin the same olive tone as mine was leaning against the kitchen counter that doubled as the bar. He looked to be in his late thirties, maybe older. His clothes couldn’t have been more ordinary, a blue striped Brooks Brothers shirt and blue blazer over chinos. There was something a little rumpled about him that reminded me of the prep school boys at Harvard who wore the same white shirt and blazer they’d had to wear in boarding school, but with a defiant', 'déshabillé.', 'You were to know they’d gone to an elite school but had become too cool for all that. That effect would have been completed with a battered pair of Top-Siders. But this man had light tan loafers of cheap-looking leather. Immigrant shoes, living-in-Queens shoes.\xa0Amir’s slouch, though, was challenging, even arrogant, in a familiar American way. It was nothing like the body language of the men I’d met in Afghanistan a couple of weeks before. They had confounded my expectations of stereotypical mountain warriors, proverbial “fierce Afghans”; they were quieter and gentler than Americans, their voices softer, their way of holding themselves dignified but never aggressive. \xa0From the start, I responded to Amir differently than I would have to a Western man. I’d taken the warnings of my friends with more experience in Afghanistan to heart: no body language that could be construed as flirtation, and never offer more physical contact than shaking a man’s hand on greeting and leave-taking.\xa0So I said hello to Amir stiffly in Dari:', 'Sh’ma khub asteed?', 'Amir broke into a smile. Lots of Americans had been going to Afghanistan lately—it was all too fashionable—but few bothered to learn Afghan Persian, or Dari.\xa0Judging my abilities correctly—I’d only been studying for a month—he answered in English, I’m fine, how are you?\xa0There might have been a note of mild parody in his reply. I laughed, and he continued, What were you doing in Mazar?\xa0A friend of mine is friends with General Dostum from the early nineties. After the Taliban fell, he wanted to go back, and he took me and another American woman with him. \xa0Dostum is a controversial figure, the unelected ruler of a good chunk of northern Afghanistan. American newspapers call him a warlord, but his forces were key in defeating the \xadTaliban; and he supports women’s education and voting rights. \xa0Amir’s warm brown eyes narrowed. He should be tried as a war criminal, he said.\xa0I remembered my dinners at Dostum’s table and how his obsidian eyes had gradually opened as he grew comfortable with my presence one night. I watched as an Afghan woman argued fiercely with him and was amazed at his patience. I would never have been the guest of a politician I thought was a war criminal, though I knew that Dostum, like the late Ahmed Shah Massoud, bore some responsibility for the destruction of Kabul in the early nineties. \xa0That’s ridiculous. No politician’s hands in Afghanistan are clean, but . . .\xa0And I argued with Amir. Soon I heard myself getting too heated. Afghanistan was not my country, and it was Amir’s. I am known for not backing down from a disagreement, but this time I decided to avoid a full-on confrontation. I told Amir I had to leave. \xa0And then I did something else I rarely did with a man. I asked for Amir’s card. I did it because I wasn’t attracted to him, because my interest was purely in the Afghan connection, or so I would have said. Anything or anyone having to do with Afghanistan was fascinating to me in the full flush of my infatuation with the country.\xa0I read the name of the consulting firm on the card. I know your firm! I worked at your main competition twenty years ago. (What a hell job that had been.) Do you like it? \xa0I’m an engineer. (Maybe that explained the shoes.) They have me doing pretty specialized assignments. It’s fine, I don’t have to travel that much. Are you still in consulting?\xa0I’m a writer. I’ve published a book, and I write book reviews, pieces on politics. I did a', 'New York Post', 'op-ed about my trip. But I make my living in business. I’m a headhunter for tax and pension lawyers—it’s an odd little niche. Listen, I’d like to talk more, but I’m still jet-lagged. It was nice to meet you, Amir.\xa0The next day, I carefully entered Amir’s information in my computer so I could get in touch with him before my next trip to Afghanistan. I didn’t like his politics, but even so I had fun talking with him. Maybe it was that I’ve never met an Afghan who spoke such good English or seemed so westernized. Even the returned Afghan American exiles I’d met in Afghanistan had more rough edges—endearing rough edges to be sure, but qualities in their speech and dress and manner that made me think they’d be out of place in my social life. No matter how aristocratic their families were in Afghanistan, in America they registered as immigranty. \xa0Four months later, in October, I arranged to go back to Afghan\xadistan for four weekes. This time I was going to teach English at the university and buy supplies for some of the pitiful primary schools I visited the first time around. I also wanted to broaden my exposure beyond Dostum’s circle and region. So I e-mailed Amir and invited him to talk about Afghanistan over coffee; I promised not to become too vehement. His response was eager and friendly—maybe he’d forgotten our spat. Something made me suggest that he come to my house for a coffee, but I picked a day when my housekeeper would be there. From my experience in Afghanistan, I figured that Amir might be uncomfortable being alone with a woman, or assume that I meant to se\xadduce him. I dressed conservatively and didn’t offer him \xadalcohol.\xa0Sitting on my living-room couch and sipping the water he’d asked for, Amir told me about himself. His family were well-connected Pashtun landowners from the mixed Pashtun and Tajik area near Herat. That made Amir the first Pashtun I’d met; the region I’d visited around Mazar was largely Uzbek. In the news coverage of the war against the Taliban I was taken with the beauty of the bearded Pashtun tribesmen, but I also absorbed some of the liberal American prejudice against this ethnic group, who’d provided the power base for the Taliban. They had a reputation as socially conservative, headstrong, and warlike. They were towelheads who toted guns and oppressed their women. Yet Amir had gone to Princeton, I learned, and seemed the soul of reason. \xa0Anger crept into his voice only when he talked about how he’d been trying to return to Afghanistan ever since the fall of the Taliban. \xa0I keep waiting and waiting for my green card. I’d like to go for a long trip. Maybe I’ll work for the government. They can use American-trained engineers. I haven’t been back since we fled to Pakistan in 1982, when I was fourteen.\xa0So you’re thirty-four? I tried to keep the surprise from my voice. He looked years older, and I liked that. He had some character to his face. At my age I was unable to see anything but generic youth in many thirty-four-year-old faces.\xa0E: 14pt; FONT-FAMILY: \'Times New Roman\'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt""Yeah, I’m old to be an associate.

I was lucky to get hired before 9/11.\xa0I looked at the clock and realized I had to leave for a friend’s reading. Somehow an hour and a half had gone by, and we’d never even talked politics. We’d have to do something about that. But when Amir returned a few days later (this time without the housekeeper present), we never got to politics. In fact, after he left I couldn’t remember much of what we talked about at all—only a sense of pleasure.\xa0Copyright © 2006 by Ann Marlowe\xa0All rights reserved.

All rights reserved.', 'ForewordFrom 2004 to 2008 I was working for Midway Games in Chicago as a visual art director on the game', 'Stranglehold', ', and later as creative visual director for the studio. Whilst I was there I was leading the Chicago concept group, and was involved in many different projects taken up by the different Midway studios. It was during this period that I was introduced to the work of a group of artists working at Midway Games in Newcastle, England, on a game called', 'Wheelman', '. I remember being at my computer reviewing the different projects that were to be presented during our annual company summit, and as I was scrolling down the presentations my finger suddenly froze. The concepts I was looking at were stunning. The environment pieces were strong, dynamic and demonstrated an excellent understanding of composition, mood and light. They were also very clear and had all the visual information necessary for production. Similarly the character concepts and story panels showed a remarkable sense of realism and storytelling. They were both dynamic and well executed. I instantly found myself wishing that this team was working with me in Chicago.A few months later Midway Games was no more and as everyone went their different ways looking for new opportunities, I found myself wondering what would happen to these artists. It didn’t take long for me to find out. I was settling into Dallas to art direct', 'Rage', 'for id Software when I was contacted by this same group and told of the creation of Atomhawk Design. I was very impressed and excited to find out that these talented artists had decided to take a big risk and start a studio from scratch in a difficult economy. Having been part of the creation of a new studio in the past I was also very aware of how difficult and challenging such a decision can be.The game industry is large and competitive and when one company creates a successful IP it doesn’t take long for the competition to try to emulate that success. To be successful, however, and to make sure their games don’t get labeled as “inferior look-alikes”, companies constantly need to find ways to technically and visually stand out. This is why concept art has become an indispensable part of the entertainment industry. Good concept art is about conveying interesting ideas and setting up compelling visions. As an art director I am always looking for those artists that not only have great skills, but can also provide me with solid and original concepts to bring strength, excitement and uniqueness to a project.In just a few years Atomhawk has managed to do just that. Not only have these artists anchored themselves firmly in an uncertain industry, but they’ve managed to do it with great skill. The art in this book not only showcases a variety of subjects and ideas, but also demonstrates a keen sense of storytelling. This is what concept art is all about: skills, technique and originality; a good understanding of the production pipeline and the needs of the clients; the ability to create unique characters, bring compelling designs to vehicles and create environments with a strong narrative. In short, it is about creating visual excitement and establishing a unique, compelling vision.Atomhawk Design has proved that it can produce great work that stands out from the crowd. As an art director I can only be excited. As a concept artist these guys will keep me on my toes. I have no doubt that our paths will cross again and look forward to the day when I will have the opportunity to work with such a talented group.

Editor,', 'West Virginia Encyclopedia', 'From the Inside Flap', ""In the small town of Hart in Lincoln County, West Virginia, acres of oak, poplar, walnut, and ash transformed modest farmers into businessmen out for wealth and blood. It was on this stage that an old feud between local clan patriarchs flared anew and the Brumfields delivered a decisive blow to their enemies, setting a bloody precedent for vigilantism and murder that would define the community for more than a half century, even after the feud itself had ended. Enterprising and clever, merchant Al Brumfield worked hard to capitalize on the regional timber boom and provide for his family. However, Brumfield's hard-edged business attitude, as well as his father's long-time quarrel with a neighbor, had garnered him numerous enemies. In September of 1889, someone ambushed and attempted to murder Brumfield and his wife. The Brumfields and their allies stopped at nothing to find the men responsible. Two local men, Milt Haley and Green McCoy, surfaced as the prime suspects. A Brumfield-led gang captured Haley and McCoy and brutally murdered them. The violence was just beginning. In this powerful true story, larger-than-life characters are caught up in vicious acts stoked by personal grievances and economic and social change. Passionate Appalachian historian Brandon Kirk seamlessly weaves oral histories, historical documents, and personal records to present the narrative from each of the main participants' point of view. In this fast-paced, gripping tale, the reader is left to determine who the real villains were. A descendant of feudists from Lincoln County, West Virginia, Brandon Kirk is an avid scholar of Appalachian history. An assistant professor of American history at Southern West Virginia Community and Technical College, Kirk shares his vast knowledge of his ancestors through lectures in the classroom and at historical venues. Through his twenty years of research, he has collected oral histories, music field recordings, photographs, and documents pertaining to his region of Appalachia. He has served as a contributor for the PBS miniseries West Virginia and as a consultant for the History Channel miniseries Hatfields and McCoys. Kirk's diverse career has included working as a university library assistant in special collections; writing for the Lincoln (WV) Journal and Lincoln (WV) Independent; collaborating on writing, musical, and movie projects with the late John Hartford; writing for the Logan (WV) Banner; and teaching advanced placement history classes in Lincoln and Logan County Schools.

All rights reserved.', 'chapter oneThe Legend1696\xa0The sloop arrived in the afternoon of April Fool’s Day 1696, swinging around the low, sandy expanse of Hog Island and into Nassau’s wide, dazzlingly blue harbor.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 At first, the villagers on the beach and the sailors in the harbor took little notice. Small and nondescript, this sloop was a familiar sight, a trading vessel from the nearby island of Eleuthera, fifty miles to the east. She came to Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas, on a regular basis to trade salt and produce for cloth and sugar, and to get news brought in from England, Jamaica, and the Carolinas. The bystanders expected to see her crew drop anchor, load their goods into their longboat, and row toward the beach, as the capital had no wharves or piers. Later, their cargoes disposed of, the crew would go drinking in one of Nassau’s public houses, trading updates of the ongoing war, the movements of the infernal French, and cursing the absence of the Royal Navy.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 But not on this day.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The sloop’s crew rowed ashore. Its captain, a local man familiar to all, jumped onto the beach, followed by several strangers. The latter wore unusual clothing: silks from India, perhaps, a kerchief in bright African patterns, headgear from Arabia, as rank and dirty as the cheap woolens worn by any common seaman. Those who came near enough to overhear their speech or peer into their tanned faces could tell they were English and Irish mariners not unlike those from other large ships that came from the far side of the Atlantic.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The party made its way through the tiny village, a few dozen houses clustered along the shore in the shadow of a modest stone fortress. They crossed the newly cleared town square, passing the island’s humble wooden church, eventually arriving at the recently built home of Governor Nicholas Trott. They stood barefoot on the sun-baked sand and dirt, the fecund smell of the tropics filling their nostrils. Townspeople stopped to stare at the wild-looking men waiting on the governor’s doorstep. A servant opened the door and, upon exchanging a few words with the sloop’s master, rushed off to inform His Excellency that an urgent message had arrived.~Nicholas Trott already had his hands full that morning. His colony was in trouble. England had been at war with France for eight years, disrupting the Bahamas’ trade and supply lines. Trott received a report that the French had captured the island of Exuma, 140 miles away, and were headed for Nassau with three warships and 320 men. Nassau had no warships at its disposal; in fact, no ships of the Royal Navy had passed this way in several years, there not being nearly enough of them to protect England’s sprawling empire. There was Fort Nassau, newly built from local stone, with twenty-eight cannon mounted on its ramparts, but with many settlers fleeing for the better protection of Jamaica, South Carolina, and Bermuda, Trott was finding it almost impossible to keep the structure manned. There were no more than seventy men left in town, including the elderly and disabled. Half the male population was serving guard duty at any one time in addition to attending to their usual occupations, which left many of them, in Trott’s words, “terribly fatigued.” Trott knew that if the French attacked in force, there was little hope of holding Nassau and the rest of New Providence, the island on which his tiny capital was perched. These were Trott’s preoccupations when he received the merchant captain from Eleuthera and his mysterious companions.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The strangers’ leader, Henry Adams, explained that he and his colleagues had recently arrived in the Bahamas aboard the', 'Fancy,', 'a private warship of forty-six guns and 113 men, and sought Trott’s permission to come into Nassau’s harbor. Adams handed over a letter from his captain, Henry Bridgeman, containing a most outlandish proposition. The', 'Fancy,', 'Bridgeman claimed, had just arrived in Eleuthera from the coast of Africa, where he had been slave trading without the permission of the Royal Africa Company, which owned a monopoly over such activities. Captain Bridgeman’s letter explained that the', 'Fancy', 'had run low on provisions and its crew was in need of shore leave. Were the governor to be so kind as to allow the ship into the harbor, he would be amply rewarded. Every member of the crew would give Trott a personal gift of twenty Spanish pieces of eight and two pieces of gold, with Bridgeman, as commander, kicking in a double share. The strangers were offering him a bribe worth some £860 at a time when a governor’s annual salary was but £300. To top it off, the crew would also give him the', 'Fancy', 'herself, once they had unloaded and disposed of the (as yet) unspecified cargo. He could pocket nearly three years of wages and become the owner of a sizeable warship simply by letting the strangers ashore and not asking any pointed questions.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Trott pocketed the letter and called an emergency meeting of the colony’s governing council. The minutes of that meeting have since been lost, but from the testimony of others in Nassau at the time, it’s clear that Governor Trott neglected to mention the bribes to the councilmen. Instead, he appealed to their shared interest in the colony’s security. The', 'Fancy,', 'he pointed out, was as large as a fifth-rate frigate of the Royal Navy, and her presence might deter a French attack. The addition of her crew would nearly double the number of able-bodied men on New Providence, ensuring that Fort Nassau’s guns would be manned in the event of an invasion. And besides, where would they be if Bridgeman chose to refit his vessel at the French port of Martinique or, worse, decided to attack Nassau itself? Violating the Royal Africa Company’s monopoly was a fairly minor crime, an insufficient reason to deny him entry.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The members of the council concurred. The governor gave Henry Adams a “very civil” letter welcoming the', 'Fancy', 'to Nassau, where she and her crew “were welcome to come and to go as they pleased.”\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Not long thereafter, a great ship rounded Hog Island,* her decks crowded with sailors, her sides pierced with gun ports, and her hull sunk low in the water under the weight of her cargo. Adams and his party were the first to come ashore, their longboat filled with bags and chests. The promised loot was there: a fortune in silver pieces of eight and golden coins minted in Arabia and beyond. Longboats ferried the crew ashore throughout the day. The rest of the crew resembled the landing party: ordinary-looking mariners dressed in oriental finery, each bearing large parcels of gold, silver, and jewels. The man calling himself Captain Bridgeman also came ashore and, after a closed meeting with Trott, turned the great warship over to him. When the governor arrived aboard the', 'Fancy,', 'he found they had left him a tip: The hold contained more than fifty tons of elephant tusks, 100 barrels of gunpowder, several chests filled with guns and muskets, and a remarkable collection of ship’s anchors.\xa0* In 1962, the Bahamian legislature renamed it Paradise Island at the request of American supermarket tycoon Huntington Hartford. It is now taken up by luxury resort hotels.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Trott would later claim to have had no reason to suspect the', 'Fancy', '’s crew of being involved in piracy. “How could I know it?” he testified under oath. “Supposition is not proof.” Captain Bridgeman and his men had claimed to be unlicensed merchants, he added, and the people of New Providence “saw no reason to disbelieve them.” But Trott was no fool. He had been a merchant captain himself and well knew that treasures of the sort the', 'Fancy', 'carried were not the product of some unsanctioned bargaining with the people of Africa’s Slave Coast. Standing aboard the', 'Fancy,', 'her hold filled with ivory and weapons, her sails patched from cannonball damage and musket balls embedded in her deck work, Trott was forced to make a choice: enforce the law or pocket the money. He didn’t ponder very long.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 On the governor’s orders, boats began ferrying the', 'Fancy', '’s remaining cargo ashore. Soon the beach was littered with chests of ivory tusks and firearms, piles of sails, anchors and tackle, barrels of gunpowder and provisions, heavy cannon and their ammunition. Trott put his personal boatswain and several African slaves aboard the ship. The ivory tusks, the pieces of eight and bags of gold coins were delivered to his private quarters. Captain Bridgeman and his men were free to drink and carouse in Nassau’s two pubs and could leave whenever they wished.\xa0Copyright © 2007 by Colin Woodard\xa0All rights reserved.

Pillaging the Empire: Piracy in the Americas, 1500-1750 (Latin American Realities);"['From Library Journal', 'Pirates followed Columbus to the New World. At first, the French, English, and Dutch governments dispatched pirates and privateers to plunder Spanish ships and settlements. Soon pirates became ""independent agents"" and plundered on their own, with Spanish shipping from the New World to Europe making easy pickings. Lane (history, William and Mary Coll.) has written widely on the histories of piracy and witchcraft and has carefully studied the pirates\' effect on the Spanish carrying trade. These were not the pirates of Treasure Island but murdering, pitiless buccaneers. Lane tells the stories without the myths, discussing such well-known pirates as Francis Drake, Henry Morgan, Piet Heyn, and Ann Bonn plus several lesser-known brigands, and he includes helpful discussions of shipbuilding, food, navigation, and more.

Writing With Power: Techniques for Mastering the Writing Process;"['Amazon.com Review', 'Whatever your reason for writing, Peter Elbow has a ""recipe"" to guide you. A longtime proponent of ""freewriting"" (writing without stopping, for a preset amount of time), Elbow incorporates its use in a variety of ways. Have a limited amount of time? Spend half of it freewriting and half of it cleaning up your prose. Got all the time in the world (and only a vague sense of what you want to say)? Freewrite, then focus, then freewrite, then focus, repeatedly, until you get ""a trustworthy vision of your final piece of writing."" Elbow offers a plethora of prompts for priming the creative pump, as well as several ways to revise the piece of writing that results: thorough revising, revising with feedback, cutting and pasting, proofreading, and the like. He pays close attention to the ways in which focusing on an audience can assist or interfere in the writing process, including a terrific chapter on the strangeness of writing for teachers, in which ""your task is usually to explain what you are still engaged in trying to understand to someone who understands it better.""

Legends: A Novel of Dissimulation;"['From Publishers Weekly', 'Starred Review. As in', 'The Company', '(2002), a long and serious chronicle of the CIA, Littell provides plenty of inside intelligence info in his superb new thriller, but he adds a decidedly comic spin. A female CIA executive looks frighteningly like Fred Astaire, while a former top agent works as a PI out of a former pool parlor above a nondescript Chinese restaurant in Brooklyn. The detective\'s name seems to be Martin Odum, but ""Fred Astaire"" calls him Dante, and he also goes by Lincoln Dittmann, the name of a Civil War enthusiast whose cartons of memorabilia sit unopened in Martin\'s office. Is Martin Odum himself a ""legend""—a fake identity dreamed up in the dark imagination of the CIA? Because he needs the work, Martin agrees to help an old Russian KGB agent find his Israeli daughter\'s husband and persuade the man to give her a ""get""—a divorce decree required by religious law. The husband has been pretending he\'s Jewish to cover up his link to a Russian criminal called the Oligarkh. As the bodies of his friends and clients begin to pile up, Odum searches for answers about not only the missing husband but also himself. Wonderful writing and a great sense of fun make this another winner. Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A former Newsweek reporter, he has produced an entertaining romp through post-Soviet Russia. Reviewers found plenty to quibble with, most notably Littell\x92s surprisingly cliché-ridden prose. But in exposing the tensions of Russia\x92s transition to capitalism, Littell approached the genre with creativity. He doesn\x92t overlook the War on Terror, either; Al Qaeda gets a walk on.

Hired to find the missing Samat so that his abandoned Israeli wife can get a proper divorce, Odum tracks his man across the continents, stumbling over a plethora of shady dealings that make Eric Ambler\'s Dimitrios seem small-time: plastic explosives, opium, bioweapons, suspicious quantities of fertilizer, the relics of a Lithuanian saint. All of which may or may not connect to the past exploits of Martin\'s other selves: the brash Irish dynamiter Dante Pippen, who infiltrates Hizbullah, and the disaffected Civil War buff Lincoln Dittman, who penetrates al-Qaeda. Littell\'s sardonic style is reminiscent of the wry slouch-and-dagger intrigue of the late, great Ross Thomas, enthusiastically embellished with spy lore and geopolitical anecdote. No respecter of the classical unities, Littell imbues his tale with the same split personality of its protagonist, veering from jocose banter to grim torture, but for readers prepared to follow his lead, he delivers a smart, fun, strange adventure in the legendary tradition of Odysseus, yet another wily trickster who boasts to his peril that he is ""no man.""', 'David Wright', 'Copyright © American Library Association.

The local priest, surfacing from a week-long binge, lit beeswax tapers to Innocent of Irkutsk, the saint who in the 1720s had repaired the road to China and was now about to bring civilization to Prigorodnaia in the form of a ribbon of macadam with a freshly painted white stripe down the middle.The peasants, who had a shrewder idea of how Mother Russia functioned, thought it more likely that this evidence of progress, if that was the correct name for it, was somehow related to the purchase, several months earlier, of the late and little lamented Lavrenti Pavlovich Beria's sprawling wooden dacha by a man identified only as the"", 'Oligarkh', '. Next to nothing was known about him. He came and went at odd hours in a glistening black Mercedes S-600 sedan, his shock of silver hair and dark glasses a fleeting apparition behind its tinted windows. A local woman hired to do laundry was said to have seen him angrily flick cigar ashes from the crow\'s-nest rising like a turret from the dacha before turning back to issue instructions to someone. The woman, who was terrified of the dacha\'s newfangled electric washing machine and scrubbed the laundry in a shallow reach of the river, had been too far away to make out more than a few words— ""Buried, that\'s what I want, but alive . . .""—but they and the \'', 'Oligarkh', ""'s feral tone had dispatched a chill down her spine that made her shudder every time she recounted the story.Two peasants cutting firewood on the other side of the river had caught a glimpse of the"", 'Oligarkh', 'from a distance, struggling on aluminum crutches along the path behind his dacha that led to the dilapidated paper factory disgorging dirty white smoke from its giant stacks fourteen hours a day, six days a week, and beyond that to the village cemetery and the small Orthodox church with the faded paint peeling away from its onion domes. A pair of Borzois rollicked in the dirt ahead of the', 'Oligarkh', 'as he thrust one hip forward and dragged the leg after it, then repeated the movement with the other hip. Three men in Ralph Lauren jeans and', 'telnyashki', ', the distinctive striped shirts that paratroopers often continued to wear after they quit the army, trailed after him, shotguns cradled in the crooks of their arms. The peasants had been sorely tempted to try for a closer look at the stubby, hunch-shouldered newcomer to their village, but abandoned the idea when one of them reminded the other what the Metropolitan come from Moscow to celebrate Orthodox Christmas two Januaries earlier had proclaimed from the ambo:', ""If you are stupid enough to dine with the devil, for Christ's sake use a long spoon."", 'The road crew, along with giant tank-treaded graders and steamrollers and trucks brimming with asphalt and crushed stone, had turned up during the night while the aurora borealis was still flickering like soundless cannon fire in the north; it didn\'t take much imagination to suppose a great war was being fought beyond the horizon. Casting elongated shadows in the ghostly gleam of headlights, the men pulled on tar-stiff overalls and knee-high rubber boots and set to work. By first light, with forty meters of paved road behind them, the aurora and the stars had vanished, but two planets were visible in the moonless sky: one, Mars, directly overhead, the other, Jupiter, still dancing in the west above the low haze saturated with the amber glow of Moscow. When the lead crew reached the circular crater that had been gouged in the dirt spur the day before by a steam shovel, the foreman blew on a whistle. The machines ground to a halt. ""Why are we stopping?"" one of the drivers, leaning out the cab of his steamroller, shouted impatiently through the face mask he\'d improvised to filter out the sulfurous stench from the paper factory. The men, who were paid by the meter and not the hour, were anxious to keep moving forward.""At any moment we are expecting Jesus to return to earth as a Russian czar,"" the foreman called back lazily. ""We don\'t want to miss it when he comes across the river."" He lit a thick Turkish cigarette from the embers of an old one and strolled down to the edge of the river that ran parallel to the road for several kilometers. It was called the Lesnia, which was the name of the dense woods it meandered through as it skirted Prigorodnaia. At 6:12 a cold sun edged above the trees and began to burn off the mustard-thick September haze that clung to the river, which was in flood, creating a margin of shallow marshes on either side; long blades of grass could be seen undulating in the current.The fisherman\'s dinghy that materialized out of the haze couldn\'t make it as far as the shore and the three occupants were obliged to climb out and wade the rest of the way. The two men wearing paratrooper shirts pulled off their boots and socks and rolled their jeans up to their knees. The third occupant didn\'t have to. He was stark naked. A crown of thorns, with blood trickling where the skin had been torn, sat on his head. A large safety pin attached to a fragment of cardboard had been passed through the flesh between his shoulder blades; on the cardboard was printed: ""The spy Kafkor."" The prisoner, his wrists and elbows bound behind him with a length of electrical wire, had several weeks growth of matted beard on his face, and purple bruises and what looked like cigarette burns over his emaciated body. Stepping cautiously through the slime until he reached solid ground, looking disoriented, he regarded his image in the shallow water of the river while the paratroopers dried their feet with an old shirt, then pulled on their socks and boots and rolled down their pants.The spy Kafkor didn\'t appear to recognize the figure gaping at him from the surface of the river.By now the two dozen crewmen, mesmerized by the arrival of the three figures, had abandoned all interest in road work. Drivers swung out of their cabs, the men with rakes or shovels stood around shifting their weight from one foot to the other in discomfort. No one doubted that something dreadful was about to happen to the naked Christ, who was being prodded up the incline by the paratroopers. Nor did they doubt that they were meant to witness it and spread the story. Such things happened all the time in Russia these days.Back on the stretch of freshly paved road, the team\'s ironmonger wiped his sweaty palms on his thick leather apron, then retrieved a lunch box from the bullock-cart piled with welding gear and scrambled up the slope to get a better view of the proceedings. The ironmonger, who was short and husky and wearing tinted steel-rimmed eyeglasses, flicked open the lid of the lunch box and reached into it to activate the hidden camera set up to shoot through a puncture in the bottom of a thermos. Casually balancing the thermos on his knees, he began to rotate the cap and snap photographs.Below, the prisoner, suddenly aware that every member of the road crew was gazing at him, seemed more distressed by his nakedness than his plight—until he caught sight of the crater. It was roughly the size of a large tractor tire. Thick planks were stacked on the ground next to it. He froze in his tracks and the paratroopers had to grasp him by the upper arms and drag him the last few meters. The prisoner sank to his knees at the lip of the crater and looked back at the workers, his eyes hollow with terror, his mouth open and gulping air with rattling gasps through a parched throat. He saw things he recognized but his brain, befuddled with chemicals released by fear, couldn\'t locate the words to describe them: the twin stacks spewing plumes of dirty white smoke, the abandoned custom\'s station with a faded red star painted above the door, the line of white-washed bee hives on a slope near a copse of stunted apple trees. This was all a terrible dream, he thought. Any moment now he would become too frightened to continue dreaming; would force himself through the membrane that separated sleep from wakefulness and wipe the sweat from his brow and, still under the spell of the nightmare, have trouble falling back to sleep. But the ground felt damp and cold under his knees and a whiff of sulfurous air stung his lungs and the cold sun playing on his skin seemed to stir the cigarette burns to pain, and the pain brought home to him that what had happened, and what was about to happen, were no dream.A Mercedes made its way slowly down the dirt road from the village, followed closely by a chase vehicle, a metallic gray Land Cruiser filled with bodyguards. Neither car had license plates, and the workers watching the scene play out understood this to mean that the people in them were too important to be stopped by the police. The Mercedes half turned so that it was astride the road and stopped a dozen meters from the kneeling prisoner. The rear window wound down the width of a fist. The', 'Oligarkh', 'could be seen peering out through dark glasses. He removed the cigar from his mouth and studied the naked prisoner for a long while, as if he were committing him and the moment to memory. Then, with a look of unadulterated malevolence on his face, he reached out with one of his crutches and tapped the man sitting next to the driver on the shoulder. The front door opened and the man emerged. He was of medium height and thin, with a long pinched face. He wore suspenders that kept his trousers hiked high on his waist, and a midnight blue Italian suit jacket draped cape-like over a starched white shirt, which was tieless and buttoned up to a very prominent Adam\'s apple. The initials ""S"" and ""U-Z"" were embroidered on the pocket of the shirt. He strode to the chase car and plucked a lighted cigarette from the mouth of one of the bodyguards. Holding it away from his body between his thumb and third finger, he walked over to the prisoner. Kafkor raised his eyes and saw the cigarette and recoiled, thinking he was about to be branded with the burning tip. But S U-Z, smiling faintly, only reached down and wedged it between the lips of the prisoner. ""It is a matter of tradition,"" he said. ""A man condemned to death is entitled to a last cigarette.""""They . . . damaged me, Samat?"" Kafkor whispered huskily. He could make out the shock of silver hair on the figure watching from the back seat of the Mercedes. ""They locked me in a basement awash in sewage, I could not distinguish night from day, I lost track of time, they woke me . . . with loud music when I fell asleep. Where, explain it to me if there exists an explanation, is the why?"" The condemned man spoke Russian with a distinct Polish accent, emphasizing the open O\'s and stressing the next to last syllable. Terror tortured his sentences into baroque grammatical configurations. ""The endmost thing I would tell to nobody is what I am not supposed to know.""Samat shrugged as if to say, The matter is out of my hands. ""You arrive too close to the flame, you must suffer burning, if only to warn others away from the flame.""Trembling, Kafkor puffed on the cigarette. The act of smoking, and the smoke cauterizing his throat, appeared to distract him. Samat stared at the ash, waiting for it to buckle under its own weight and fall so they could get on with the execution. Kafkor, sucking on the cigarette, became aware of the ash, too. Life itself seemed to ride on it.Defying gravity, defying sense, it grew longer than the unsmoked part of the cigarette.And then a whisper of wind coming off the river dislodged the ash. Kafkor spit out the butt. ""\'', 'Poshol ty na khuy', ',"" he whispered, carefully articulating each of the O\'s in ""\'', 'Poshol', '."" ""\'', 'Go impale yourself on a prick', '."" He rocked back on his heels and squinted in the direction of the copse of stunted apple trees on the slope above him. ""Look!"" he blurted out, vanquishing terror only to confront a new enemy, madness. ""Up there!"" He sucked in his breath. ""I see the elephant. It can be said that the beast is revolting.""The', 'Oligarkh', 'shook his head. ""Trust me, Kristyna—he will be warmer in the ground if the hole is covered with snow.""""He is the same as a son to me,"" the woman sobbed, her voice fading to a cracked whimper. ""We must not bury him before he has had his lunch.""Still on her knees, the woman, shuddering with sobs, started to crawl through the dirt toward the crater. In the back of the Mercedes, the', 'Oligarkh', 'gestured with a finger. The driver sprang from behind the wheel and, pressing the palm of his hand to the woman\'s mouth, half carried, half dragged her back to the car and folded her body into the back seat. Before the door slammed shut she could be heard sobbing: ""And if it does not snow, what then?""Oligarkh watched the scene unfold through its tinted glass. The two paratroopers took a grip on the prisoner\'s arms and lifted him into the crater and set him down on his side, curled up in a fetal position in the round hole. Then they began covering the crater with the thick planks, kicking the ends into the ground so that the tops of the planks were flush with the dirt road. When that was done they dragged a section of metal webbing over the planks. All the while nobody spoke. On the slope the workers, puffing on cigarettes, looked away or stared at their feet.When the paratroopers finished covering the crater, they backed off to admire their handiwork. One of them waved to the driver of a truck. He climbed behind the wheel and backed up to the crater and worked the lever that elevated the flatbed to spill tarmacadam onto the road. Several workers came over and spread the macadam with long rakes until a thick glistening coating covered the wooden planks and they were no longer visible. They stepped away and the paratroopers signaled for the steamroller. Black fume billowed from its exhaust pipe as the rusty machine lumbered to the edge of the crater. When the driver seemed to hesitate, the horn of the Mercedes sounded and one of the bodyguards standing nearby pumped an arm in irritation. ""It is not as if we have all day,"" he shouted above the bedlam of the steamroller\'s engine. The driver threw it into gear and started across the crater, packing down the tarmacadam. When he reached the other side, he backed over it again and then swung out of the cab to inspect the newly paved patch of highway. Suddenly, he tore off his improvised face mask and, bending, vomited on his shoes. Barely making a sound, the Mercedes backed and filled and swung past the chase car and started up the dirt spur toward the sprawling wooden dacha at the edge of the village of Prigorodnaia, soon to be connected to the Moscow-Petersburg highway—and the world—by a ribbon of macadam with a freshly painted white stripe down the middle.', 'Read more']";14.67;Robert Littell (Author);['Books', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense'];"{'Publisher': 'The Overlook Press; First Edition (April 21, 2005)', 'Language': 'English', 'Hardcover': '386 pages', 'ISBN 10': '9781585676965', 'ISBN 13': '978-1585676965', 'Reading age': '18 years and up', 'Item Weight': '1 pounds', 'Dimensions': '6.34 x 1.36 x 9.3 inches'}";1585676969

All rights reserved.', 'Introduction  0 From ancient mythmakers to modern scientific explorers, human beings have always striven to understand the nature of the cosmos. The sky¿with its vast, infinite presence¿has inspired awe in all of humanity. Ancient Mayans would literally converse with planetary bodies as they integrated both religious ritual and mathematical equations to predict cosmic phenomena. Humanity has always posed questions about the origins of the universe: Where do we come from? Is the universe self-contained or infinite? Is there a beginning and an end? These are profound questions that have left both mythmakers and cosmologists struggling to grasp the enormity of the universe. The parallels between creation myths and scientific models are closely aligned, and they reflect the universal mystery that compels all of us to want to know why and how we are here. What is our purpose and what place does spirituality and science have in our lives? In Marcelo Gleiser¿s book The Dancing Universe, the author compares the three models of creation myths to the three quantitative models theorized by the scientific community: creation out of something, creation out of nothing, and order out of chaos.  In an attempt to define the mysteries that underlie our existence, we have employed a wealth of symbols and metaphors, including archetypes, symbols that appear throughout human history. Carl Jung, the twentieth-century psychoanalyst, described archetypes as being contained in that reservoir of shared memories passed down through the millennia, our collective unconscious: ¿The concept of the archetype, which is an indispensable correlate of the idea of the collective unconscious, indicates the existence of definite forms in the psyche which seem to be present always and everywhere¿ (Jung 42). These archetypal patterns reside deep in the core of our being and surface in dreams, poetry, artwork, and in other forms of creative expression. Myths are part of the psychic heritage that has become embedded in the deep-seated memories comprising our collective psyches. The collective unconscious is what connects us to the past, present, and future, and helps to bind all human beings in a fabric of shared experience.   As we progress down new scientific roads of discovery, there is renewed consideration given to ancient methods of charting celestial movements. Many books focusing on archeoastronomy (the study of astronomical methods utilized by the ancients) share shelf space with books explaining new discoveries and modern theories. We are beginning to see the relevance of connecting with our past as we continue exploring possibilities for the future. Contemplating the divine aspects of our universe is as important as unlocking new theories about its origins. We need the quantitative measures of scientific models to prove theories about the universe. But we also need the mysticism and the human spirit that motivated mythmakers to explain their surroundings. Both disciplines have striven to understand the cosmos. Both disciplines are driven by awe at the immensity of the universe. And neither has been able to prove the origins of the universe. Yet humanity holds on to faith in the face of the inexplicable. As we unlock more answers about nature, we find that there are so many questions lying just beneath the surface. This pattern of question and answer is seemingly infinite, leading one to believe that there will always be a need for both science and faith to help move uus forward.  The Space Shuttle Columbia on mission STS-93, commanded by Eileen Collins (the first woman at the helm of a space shuttle), launched the Chandra X-ray observatory. The name ¿Chandra¿ is a shortened version of the late Nobel Laureate Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar¿s name. Chandrasekhar or ¿Chandra,¿ one of the foremost astrophysicists of the twentieth century, helped shed light on the nature of black holes. Chandra is also a Hindu moon god (in Sanskrit, the word means ¿luminous¿). It is not so ironic that this name was chosen out of 6,000 entries across the country. As we move further into the deep, uncharted realms of the universe, we yearn to embrace the divine as a means of digesting the enormity of the cosmic void. Science is providing us with beautiful, inspiring, visual references of celestial hosts literally billions of light years away. In order to connect with those images and not be too overwhelmed by the confounding distances, we need to celebrate the very mystery of these celestial wonders. Again, we start asking ourselves fundamental questions about our surroundings, much like the ancients did thousands of years ago. Celestial goddesses are like old, consistent friends. Their various roles on the cosmic stage continue to fascinate and reassure us even in the face of scientific challenges. Technology will not supplant our need to nurture our spirituality, it will only reinforce it.  Reverence for the feminine divine is a manifestation of this shared experience. We know intuitively that her power is part of our past, present, and future. The goddess¿ transformative powers are a part of our daily experience, from the life-giving process of birth to the diurnal cycle dictated by the heavens. The goddess is an inherent part of the cosmic pulse of conception, death, and renewal. This cycle coincides with the phases of the moon, the rising and setting of the sun, and the female menstrual cycle. By reconnecting with the goddess on a conscious level, we begin to truly participate in the mysteries that inhabit our skies and our own internal cosmos. The more we allow ourselves to indulge in the spiritual essence of her presence, the more heightened our senses will become.   It is important to meditate on the goddess as we continue to observe the heavens. The inscrutable nature of the universe is as miraculous as conception and birth. The ubiquitous goddess has given us a wealth of stories and symbols to help us connect with the essence of our souls. The many images and stories that I have presented in this collection showcase the similarities that all goddesses from disparate cultures share. Many of the elements and symbols contained in the paintings represent the merging of the conscious with the unconscious. In the entry for Luonnotar, the Finnish goddess is shown floating upon the primordial waters of chaos until the breaking of eggs releases consciousness and allows life to flourish. Another example of the bridge between unconsciousness and consciousness is exemplified when the Sumerian goddess Inanna breaks away from the smothering embrace of the earth and emerges into a new, conscious state on the surface. The moon and sun are also considered symbols of unconsciousness and consciousness, respectively. Lunar mysteries stem from the fact that the moon is present during the night or unconscious state and the sun coincides with light and consciousness.  The symbolic polarity present in some of my images is a reflection of thhe balance necessary for the sustenance of life. This can even be observed at the subatomic level. Atoms are comprised of protons, electrons, and neutrons that work together to maintain a neutral charge. Life could not exist without this delicate balance. So, too, the sun goddess¿ travels across the heavens are juxtaposed by her sojourns under the Earth and into unconsciousness during the hours of darkness. Without light, there would be no dark; without dark, one would not recognize light. The many symbolic images in this book are an attempt to tap into this subconscious level. The paintings are meant to act as tools of contemplation and will hopefully help the viewer identify the nurturing power of the feminine divine. By identifying the beauty and strength that is the goddess, we can learn to harness positive goddess energy and use it to help ourselves become stronger, more intrinsic players in the universe.  The expansion of mass media, the connective capabilities of the World Wide Web, and the ever-advancing space telescopes are leading to profound changes that will forever alter the human landscape. It is the human spirit and our connection with the divine that provides us with the courage to move forward and climb higher pinnacles of achievement.  As we move closer to universal consciousness, what better vehicle for being prepared for such profound thought processes than by contemplating celestial goddesses and their various roles on the cosmic stage? By reflecting on the goddess, we will be better equipped to ponder the complexities of science. In Edward O. Wilson¿s book Consilience, the author states that ¿science needs the intuition and metaphorical power of the arts, and the arts need the fresh blood of science¿ (Wilson 230). By depicting the goddess in her myriad of forms and personalities, I am interpreting the divine mysteries of the universe in a tangible form that we all can relate to, regardless of gender or race.  Considering information from complementary disciplines will enable us to grow intellectually as well as spiritually. Contemplating the mysteries of the universe facilitates creative thinking. In true Zen form, the more we learn, the more we need to learn. The internal spirit, the essence of our being, is what is touched by the goddess. If we let our internal voices guide us into pure, contemplative thought processes, then we can examine the quantitative measures of science with an enhanced feeling of awe and reverence. We become more emotionally connected, more spiritually elevated, and ultimately better, more flexible observers of nature. We need the goddess to be a part of our conscious beings as we move forward into a new millennium of astounding scientific discoveries. And as we acquire more scientific understanding about the cosmos, perhaps we can acquire a deeper connection with the goddess.  How to Use This Book  0 With all the changes that are going on in the world, from technology to our own personal relationships, the one thing that seems to remain fairly constant is the universe. Of course this is not entirely true, but due to our relatively brief physical life spans we can be lulled into the comfortable illusion of cosmic constancy. Human beings are instinctively drawn to the beauty of the stars. We write songs and poems about the glorious sunrise and the romance of a star-strewn night. We are drawn to the mysterious and unattainable nature of the moon and planets. But when we look to the stars andd celestial bodies for inspiration, we may also be intimidated by the sheer enormity of it all. It can be difficult not to feel insignificant and downright overwhelmed when contemplating distances that would take a thousand generations to cross. This is the science of the universe as we know it. But where does spirituality fit into this scheme? Is there any room remaining in our fact-jumbled minds for the divine?   Meditation helps us to weed through the detritus of our day-to-day lives in order to get to the pure, creative, fluid part of our mind. This part of our being can be our sanctuary. It is a place where we can explore, nurture, expand, and refresh. It is our personal getaway where no one else has to go. It is our personal playground, a placid beach, a verdant forest, and anything we choose it to be. By going within to this personal and tranquil place, we can see ourselves from a different perspective and perhaps view our life situations with a more objective eye. It is also a place where we can convene with the goddess and contemplate the cosmos.  By employing meditation techniques, we can nurture a relationship with the goddess that can help us to understand our importance in the grand scheme of things. The goddess can provide you with a link to cosmic energy by helping you to explore your own subconscious. Our psyches are like microcosmic reflections of the vast, magnificent universe in which we reside. The goddesses in this collection mirror the patterns or archetypes that surface again and again in world mythologies. By meditating on stories of the goddess, we can allow her to accompany us on our personal quest to understand the nature of the universe and appreciate the limitless knowledge, energy, and creativity contained within our subconscious.  Why Meditate?  Since it is so easy to become distracted by day-to-day concerns, it is important to set aside quiet time to ponder the marvelous goings-on within your own mind. After all, how can we digest the immensity of the universe if we do not take time to nurture our own being? Meditation can help to bring equilibrium and a sense of peace into your life. Through meditation, you will be able to nurture a relationship with yourself by cultivating a relationship with the goddess. The celestial goddess can be a reflection of who we are or who we would like to become.   How to Meditate  No matter how hard we try to balance the complexities of our lives, there is usually something that infiltrates our positive well-being. Perhaps you get stuck in traffic, or you have a falling-out with your best friend, or you burn the beans cooking dinner. No matter how well-managed your life is or how even-tempered you are, it is hard not to experience some level of stress throughout the course of the day. Knowing that you have the option to meditate can help you to deal with your daily mishaps. Meditation is your quiet time. You can look forward to this relaxation time . . . time to recenter and cleanse yourself of your own internal pollution.  When I use the term ¿meditation,¿ I am not referring to the practices of any particular culture or religion. Meditation is a versatile form of relaxation: You are free to delve into this exercise in any manner that you choose, taking bits and pieces of ideas and practices that feel right to you. You can meditate in the shower, while you walk, or during your lunch break. You can also customize your meditations to include objects, other people, or both.    It may be difficult to get started, but once you incorporate meditation into your routine, it will become a daily ritual that you look forward to. Meditation is also inexpensive¿it does not require the inclusion of any instruments or tools.  Meditation can help release creativity and facilitate artistic endeavors, even if you do not have a propensity to express yourself in this manner. I engage myself in a meditative state when I sketch ideas. I feel that the celestial goddess guided my pencil and brush as I painted the images you see in this book. Her image can manifest itself in many styles and forms during this automatic process. But you do not have to be an artist to experience this. You can use meditation as a tool for releasing thoughts and ideas and for helping you to look at your life with a fresh perspective. Daily routines such as cooking, gardening, and shopping can all be enhanced by employing meditation techniques. In Barbara Ardinger¿s book Goddess Meditations, the author states that ¿meditation is a process whose aim is to quiet the body so the mind can work creatively. It tames the left brain so the right brain becomes free¿ (Ardinger 10). I find this observation to be quite accurate and useful. I feel it is essential to cleanse my mind by meditating before embarking on a creative endeavor.  Here is a list of techniques that may be helpful for you as you try to determine what techniques best work for your particular needs:  ¿ breathing  ¿ visualization and imagery; this technique is ideal   when applied to this book  ¿ taking a walk  ¿ engaging in a creative activity, i.e., sketching, stitching,   painting, ceramics, etc.  ¿ positioning yourself: standing, sitting, or lying down  ¿ guided group meditation  ¿ focusing on an object, i.e., a statue of a goddess  Letting the Goddess Work for You  To begin, familiarize yourself with her stories and then study the images in the book. You do not have to be rehearsed in goddess lore or be exceptionally creative, for this book is designed to assist the beginner as well as those who have already established a relationship with the feminine divine. The meditations are meant to be used as a springboard to help you access the wealth of ideas and imagery that are stored within your subconscious, so feel free to expand on what I have provided for you. The more you practice visualization, the more complex and immersive your meditative journeys will become. Visualization, or using imagery to help you with your meditations, is a good technique for those who have a hard time letting go of ¿reality.¿ The introduction of a visual element will oftentimes help facilitate the relaxation process. It will provide a point of focus¿ a gateway into the quietude of the subconscious.  It is imperative that you relax and symbolically shed the stresses of the day as preparation for your meditation. I love to take evening walks when the skies are clear and the goddess and the stars speak to me from the blue firmament. Even if I was feeling fatigued or uninspired before my walk, I will often return feeling revitalized and ready to continue writing or sketching. Another of my relaxation techniques is to take a shower in the dark with the window blinds open. This way I can view the stars and moon while the water is cleansing my body (of course, only do this if you feel safe doing so). Try this during the day and you can imagine the sun goddess Saule¿s golden liquid cleansing you with its nurturing propertiies. Another way to help prepare yourself for meditation is to take an aromatherapeutic bath with or without strategically placed candles around the tub. I also decorate my home in a celestial motif by hanging moons and stars from the walls and ceilings. These little acts help me to feel peace and harmony within my household. By indulging in these simple pleasures, you can learn how to reestablish inner equilibrium and more easily fall into a meditative state.   My husband uses meditation as a means of organizing his thoughts. He takes daily meditation breaks by lying down on the bed, closing his eyes, and reviewing what he needs to accomplish to clear his ¿things to do¿ list. After this refresher, when all his internal papers have been filed away, he will emerge from his meditation reenergized and ready to expedite work in an efficient and relaxed manner. Meditation is an exercise as important as any physical exercise. It is important to keep your mind fit and free of unnecessary stress buildup. If you allow stresses to hibernate in your subconscious without properly disposing yourself of them, you run the risk of depleting your body of good, healthy energy.  You can also incorporate elements from the goddess¿ stories into your meditation. If you feel you will meditate more successfully by holding or focusing on an object that symbolizes the goddess and her story, by all means do so. For example, White Shell Woman uses a crystal to bring fire to humanity. Try burning a candle and holding a crystal during your journey.  Meditations and visualizations can be performed in group situations or in a solitary manner. I have experienced both and prefer the peace and quietude afforded within my own home. A group meditation can be a wonderful way to feel the transference of energy from one person to another. In the meditation I have provided for Mawu, you can mimic the group circle by meditating with others.  0  The goddess¿ ability to maintain beauty, grace, and strength in the face of adversity reminds us to see the light even during some of our darkest moments. The celestial goddesses are universal yet intensely personal guides who can usher us through our life journeys, helping us to put our fears aside and teaching us how to thrive on challenge. Allow them to aid you in confronting problems in a more effective and rational manner. Above all else, the goddesses remind us that we are not alone in this vast universe. We are the intertwined roots of a grand cosmic tree.  So let us begin. Browse through the book and start with a goddess you feel particularly drawn to. This book is meant to be used over and over again. The more you study it, the more you will be able to extract from the imagery. May you nurture a beautiful relationship with each and every manifestation of the celestial goddess. She has so much to show you.  Amaterasu  0 Amaterasu, whose name means ¿Shining Heaven,¿ rules the heavens and brings warmth and light to the world. She is the Japanese Shinto goddess responsible for cultivating rice fields, creating irrigation canals, and teaching mortals the arts of weaving, farming silk, and cultivating food. The great sun goddess was so radiant at her birth that her parents placed her in the sky where she could shine in the celestial realms.  But, alas, her life-giving rays disappeared for a time after her jealous brother Susanowo fell into a rampage and began to destroy Amaterasu¿s creations. He trampled on her rice fields, left excreement in her temples, and tossed a flayed piebald horse through a roof, killing several weaving women. Amaterasu retreated from the violence by finding refuge in a cave. There she hid herself in protest, causing the world to fall into a wintry plight. Plants began to wither and people began to deteriorate as darkness gripped the land in cold talons.  The gods became alarmed at the dire situation and began to devise a scheme to lure the sun goddess from her cave. The 800 gods gathered around the cave entrance, hung trees with jewels, and placed cocks near the threshold. The erotic goddess Uzume adorned herself with bamboo leaves and began to dance in a manner that created uproarious laughter and cheer. During Uzume¿s performance, one of the gods placed a mirror in front of the cave entrance.  Amaterasu became curious at the growing ruckus outside her hiding place. She carefully opened the cave door, and there she gazed upon the most beautiful reflection she had ever seen. Amaterasu had never seen herself before, so she was spellbound by her own shining countenance in the mirror. She left the cavernous womb and allowed her brilliant rays to spill upon the landscape. She rejoined the company of the gods and reclaimed her place in the sky. The gods banished Susanowo from the heavens, and life and fertility were restored to the land.  Amaterasu¿s worship is still honored today, and the Japanese imperial family traces their heritage to the sun goddess.  Imagine standing within a damp, chilly tunnel. Darkness feeds your fears as you try to discern a means of escape. Focus hard on a crack in the rock ahead and see a flicker of light. A stream of light expands and permeates the dark cavern. Feel the light beam warm your fingertips and travel up your arms as you begin to move forward. As you lengthen your strides, feel the light continue to travel through your body until it fills your being completely and dissolves the fortress of claustrophobic darkness.   You see an image in the light, and as you squint you can make out your own countenance. It is a smiling reflection of yourself. You look confident, bold, empowered, and beautiful. Walk into your reflection and feel yourself absorbed by the positive solar energy. You feel alive, energetic, brazen. With this new outlook, continue to walk forward into a beautiful, fertile landscape that unfolds before your eyes. You have left the tunnel behind and are now breathing in the fresh, balmy air. Stretch out your arms and breathe deeply; as you breathe out, lower your arms and feel yourself emerge, feeling more confident and alive. Allow yourself to return to your conscious body.  By recognizing the power of your own inner beauty, you will exude an external beauty   and energy that will enable you to live   more happily and confidently.   0  Arianrhod   0 Arianrhod is the Welsh goddess known as Silver Wheel, who is associated with the moon, night, fertility, magic, and reincarnation. She also is known by the name Silver Goddess of the Dawn.  As the daughter of the great Welsh mother goddess Don, Arianrhod is a beautiful and powerful young deity who lures many seamen into her seductive embrace. Despite her many liaisons with the sea folk, she remains independent and continues to reside in a castle on the secluded island of Caer Arianrhod.  In the Mabinogion, a collection of medieval Welsh stories, a story is told of how Arianrhod was summoned by Math, son of Mathonwy, and her brother Gwydion to prove herr virginity so that she could provide Math with a lap for his tired feet. She was ordered to step over a rod, but in doing so, she gave birth to two children. One was a blonde boy who crawled away and joined the sea folk to become Dylan-Son-of-the-Wave. The other was a fetus whom Gwydion recognized as his own offspring. Gwydion quickly absconded with the fetus and hid him in a magical chest until the fetus was strong enough to breathe on his own. Feeling violated, Arianrhod exercised a Welsh mother¿s right to refuse the fetus three things: a name, the right to bear arms, and a human wife. But Gwydion and his son were later able to outwit Arianrhod when they donned disguises and paid her a visit. She inadvertently named the boy Llew Llaw Gyffes, or ¿The Bright One of the Skillful Hand,¿ after she witnessed the boy kill a wren with a single stone fling. She also provided him with a sword, thus giving him arms. Later Math and Gwydion went to the forest and produced a wife made out of flowers for Llew Llaw Gyffes. The new companion was named Blodeuwedd, or ¿Flower Face.¿  It is said that this story illustrates the decline of goddess-oriented societies at the hands of the patriarchal clans. Even so, Arianrhod¿s status as a deity earned her a place in the constellations as a resident of the Corona Borealis.  You are standing on a moonlit mound surrounded by monoliths engraved with spirals. The goddess Arianrhod appears out of the fog and smiles. She reaches out and you willingly allow her to take your hand. You admire her shimmering presence and feel her tingling energy travel up your arm and into your heart. She leads you to a long branch that hangs down from an ancient tree covered with vines. Arianrhod beckons you to leap over it with her. You try to look past the branch, but are unable to see through a thick fog. You feel a little apprehensive as she leads you forward. You take a deep breath as you jump over. You feel, rather than see, a carpet of stars sweep past your feet. Arianrhod continues to hold your hand as she leads you on a flight past celestial bodies of magnificent colors. You see silver wheels spinning past, and time becomes irrelevant. The new sensation washes away your inhibitions and you feel energized. The wheels continue to float past, and you realize that there are no endings: The wheels turn infinitely, like the continuous birth of stars in an endless universe. Feel your body begin to descend and soon you are back on solid soil. Breathe out and return to your conscious body.   The leap over the branch has shown you that life is continuous and new beginnings are part of our journey. Embrace new beginnings and enjoy the challenges that new flights   will reward you with.']";3.18;Lisa Hunt (Author);['Books', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'New Age & Spirituality'];{'Publisher': 'Llewellyn Publications (October 8, 2001)', 'Language': 'English', 'Hardcover': '144 pages', 'ISBN 10': '0738701181', 'ISBN 13': '978-0738701189', 'Item Weight': '1.45 pounds', 'Dimensions': '8.25 x 0.5 x 10.25 inches'};0738701181

The Alibi;"['Amazon.com Review', ""Sandra Brown's two previous novels,"", 'Unspeakable', 'and', 'Fat Tuesday', ', earned her a loyal band of romantic suspense fans and', 'The Alibi', 'is sure to increase the following. Mixing a little murder, some corruption, and a good bit of illicit romance, this novel makes the golf courses of Charleston, South Carolina, seem as seedy and fascinating as the back alleys of Chinatown.', ""Hammond Cross wants to be the district attorney, and for years he has proven himself to be a man of high principles and irreproachable character. When his investigations turn up evidence of the corruption of local tycoon Lute Pettijohn, Hammond has no doubt about what is the right thing to do--even when his own father is under suspicion. However, this simple debate becomes complicated when Pettijohn is murdered and Hammond's alibi is a night of forbidden passion with the suspected murderess, Dr. Alex Ladd."", ""Brown's quick dialogue, character quirks, and plot twists help give a modern bent to the classic detective tale. While some of the characters prance across the pages with a predictability that would make Dashiell Hammett proud (the drunk-makes-good assistant, the light-hair-dark-history socialite) most of the characters show refreshing individuality. As Hammond's internal conflict intensifies--and the passion and danger do, too--readers will find all criticisms vanishing as they blast their way through this suspenseful page-turner."", ""--Nancy R.E. O'Brien"", '--This text refers to an alternate', 'kindle_edition', 'edition.', 'From Publishers Weekly', ""The prolific Brown (Unspeakable) undoubtedly has another bestseller in her latest suspense novel, which catches its protagonist in a tricky ethical situation. When Charleston real estate developer Lute Pettijohn is murdered in the penthouse suite of the posh hotel he recently built, there is no shortage of likely suspects; Pettijohn is one of the most hated men in town. On the same night that the murder occurs, assistant district attorney Hammond Cross attends a county fair, where he meets a mysterious woman who refuses to tell him her name. But Cross is so smitten he cajoles her into spending the night with him in his country cabin. Later, when a witness places the woman, now identified as respected psychologist Dr. Alex Ladd, at the scene of the crime, she becomes the number one suspect. Hammond, the prosecutor on the case, finds himself furious at, suspicious of and in love with the beautiful Ladd. Her alibi, obviously, is that she was with him when the crime was committed, but it turns out that she could have shot Pettijohn and still managed to turn up at the fair. Hammond believes her innocent, however, and in spite of his ambitions for higher office, he risks his career to find the real killer. Brown's gift for taut pacing compresses the time frame of the book into one short week, and she mixes the suspense with steamy romance. A web of labyrinthine relationships becomes ever more intricate until the identity of the killer is revealed, a shock that would be implausible in a less carefully constructed tale.

Charleston assistant district attorney Hammond Cross unaccountably finds himself at a county fair, where he meets a mysterious woman and saves her from hungry servicemen. She leads him on, then fades into the night. Meanwhile, Charleston's biggest developer and satyr, Lute Petitjohn, is murdered in the Charles Towne Plaza. Lute was the exbrother-in-law of top detective Rory Smilow, who is investigating the murder and whom sexy assistant county solicitor Steffi Mundell begs to help her land this superhigh-profile case. All avenues at last lead to Dr. Alex Ladd, the very woman Hammond was dancing with while the murder occurred.

Set in Charleston, South Carolina, the novel offers the southern location and attitude for which Brown is known. The climate is steamy and so is the chance meeting and sexual encounter of District Attorney Hammond Cross and a mysterious but irresistible woman. How could he know that she would be the prime suspect in the murder of one of the city's leading citizens? How could he know that he would be able to provide her with an airtight alibi for the time of the murder? Suspicion of her motives and fear for his own reputation and political future stop him from coming forward but don't prevent him from working to solve the crime himself. His search for the truth is complicated by a sultry, ambitious woman colleague who is after his job; a politically crafty father with shady connections to the murdered man; a stiffly proper and tightly controlled police investigator; and a whole pile of other supporting characters, all with their own crooked, violent, promiscuous, and otherwise unsavory but interesting quirks.

Even in a crowd of other women dressed, for the most part, in skimpy summer clothing, she was definitely a standout. Surprisingly, she was alone.', 'As she paused to get her bearings, her gaze stopped briefly on the dais, where the band was performing, before moving to the dance floor, then to the haphazard arrangement of chairs and tables surrounding it. Spotting a vacant table, she moved to it and sat down.', 'The pavilion was round in shape, about thirty yards in diameter. Although it was an open-air structure with a conical roof, the underside of which was strung with clear Christmas lights, the pitched ceiling trapped the noise inside, making the din incredible.', ""What the band lacked in musical talent they made up for with volume, obviously of the opinion that decibels would make their missed notes less discernible. They did, however, play with raucous enthusiasm and showmanship. On the keyboard and guitar, the musicians seemed to be pounding the notes out of their instruments. The harmonica player's braided beard bounced with every jerking motion of his head. As the fiddler sawed his bow across the strings, he danced an energetic jig that showed off his yellow cowboy boots. The drummer seemed to know only one cadence, but he applied himself to it with verve."", ""The crowd didn't seem to mind the discordant sound. For that matter, neither did Hammond Cross. Ironically, the racket of the county fair was somehow soothing. He absorbed the noise-the squeals coming from the midway, catcalls from rowdy teenage boys at the top of the Ferris wheel, the crying of babies grown tired, the bells and whistles and horns, the shouts and laughter inherent to a carnival."", ""Going to a county fair hadn't been on his agenda today. Although there had probably been some advance publicity about it in the local newspaper and on TV, it had escaped his notice."", ""He'd happened on the fair by accident about a half hour outside of Charleston. What had compelled him to stop, he would never know. It wasn't like he was an avid carnival-goer. His parents certainly had never taken him to one. They had avoided general-public attractions like this at all costs. Not exactly their crowd. Not their kind of people."", ""Ordinarily Hammond probably would have avoided it, too. Not because he was a snob, but because he worked such long, hard hours, he was selfish with his leisure time and selective about how he spent it. A round of golf, a couple hours of fishing, a movie, a quiet dinner at a good restaurant. But a county fair? That wouldn't have topped his list of pleasurable pursuits."", 'But this afternoon in particular the crowd and the noise appealed to him. Left alone, he only would have brooded over his troubles. He would have reflected himself into despondency, and who needed that on one of the few remaining weekends of the summer?', 'So when his highway speed was reduced to a crawl and he got trapped in the traffic inching into the temporary parking lot-actually a cow pasture turned parking lot by an enterprising farmer-he had remained in line with the other cars and vans and SUVs.', ""He paid two bucks to the tobacco-chewing youth who was collecting for the farmer and was fortunate enough to find a spot for his car beneath a shade tree. Before getting out, he removed his suit jacket and tie, and rolled up his shirtsleeves. As he picked his way carefully around cow patties, he wished for blue jeans and boots instead of dress slacks and loafers, but already he felt his spirits rising. Nobody here knew him. He didn't have to talk to anyone if he didn't want to. There were no obligations to be met, no meetings to attend, no telephone messages to return. Out here he wasn't a professional, or a colleague. Or a son. Tension, anger, and the weight of responsibility began to melt off him. The sense of freedom was heady."", ""The fairgrounds were demarcated by a plastic rope strung with multicolored pennants that hung still and limp in the heat. The dense air was redolent with the tantalizing aromas of cooking food-junk food. From a distance, the music didn't sound half bad. Hammond was immediately glad he had stopped. He needed this ... isolation."", 'Because despite the people streaming through the turnstile, he was, in a very real sense, isolated. Being absorbed by a large, noisy crowd suddenly seemed preferable to spending a solitary evening in his cabin, which had been his original plan upon leaving Charleston.', 'The band had played two songs since the auburn-haired woman had sat down across the pavilion from where he was seated. Hammond had continued to watch her, and to speculate. Most likely she was waiting for someone to join her, probably a husband and assorted children. She appeared to be not quite as old as he, maybe early thirties. About the age of the carpool-driving set. Cub Scout den mothers. PTA officers. The homemakers concerned with DPT booster shots, orthodontia, and getting their laundry whites white and their colors bright. What he knew of such women he had learned from TV commercials, but she seemed to fit that general demographic.', 'Except that she was a little too ... too ... edgy.', ""She didn't look like a mother of young children who was enjoying a few minutes' respite while Daddy took the kids for a ride on the carousel. She didn't have the cool, competent air of his acquaintances' wives who were members of Junior League and other civic clubs, who went to salad luncheons and hosted birthday parties for their kids and dinner parties for their husbands' business associates, and who played golf or tennis at their respective country clubs once or twice a week between their aerobics classes and Bible study circles."", ""She didn't have the soft, settled body of a woman who had borne two or three offspring, either. Her figure was compact and athletic. She had good-no, great-legs that were muscled, sleek, and tan, shown off by a short skirt and low-heeled sandals. Her sleeveless top had a scooped neck, like a tank top, and a matching cardigan which had been knotted loosely around her neck before she had removed it. The outfit was smart and chic, a cut above what most of this shorts-and-sneakers crowd was wearing."", ""Her handbag, which she'd placed on the table, was big enough only for a key ring, a tissue, and possibly a lipstick, but nowhere near large enough for a young mother whose purse was packed with bottled water and Handi Wipes and natural snacks and enough equipment to survive days in the wilderness should an emergency situation arise."", 'Hammond had an analytical mind. Deductive reasoning was his forte. So he concluded, with what he felt was a fair degree of accuracy, that it was unlikely this woman was a mom.', ""That did not mean that she wasn't married, or otherwise attached, and waiting to be joined by a significant other, whoever he might be and whatever the nature of their relationship. She could be a woman devoted to a career. A mover and a shaker in the business community. A successful salesperson. A savvy entrepreneur. A stockbroker. A loan officer."", 'Sipping his beer, which was growing tepid in the heat, Hammond continued to stare at her with interest.', ""Then suddenly he realized that his stare was being returned. When their eyes met, his heart lurched, perhaps from embarrassment for having been caught staring. But he didn't look away. Despite the dancers that passed between them, intermittently blocking their line of sight, they maintained eye contact for several seconds."", ""Then she abruptly broke it, as though she might also be embarrassed for having picked him out of the crowd. Chagrined over having such a juvenile reaction to something as insignificant as making eye contact, Hammond relinquished his table to two couples who'd been hovering nearby waiting for one to become available. He weaved his way through the press of people toward the temporary bar. It had been set up during the fair to accommodate the thirsty dancers."", ""It was a popular spot. Personnel from the various military bases in the area were standing three deep at the bar. Even if not in uniform, they were identifiable by their sheared heads. They were drinking, scoping out the girls, weighing their chances of getting lucky, wagering on who would and who wouldn't, playing one-upmanship."", ""The bartenders were dispensing beer as fast as they could, but they couldn't keep up with the demand. Hammond tried several times to flag one's attention but finally gave up and decided to wait until the crowd had thinned out before ordering another."", ""Feeling a little less pathetic than he had no doubt looked sitting alone at his table, he glanced across the dance floor toward her table. His spirits drooped. Three men now occupied the extra chairs at her table. In fact, the wide shoulders of one were blocking her from Hammond's view. The trio weren't in uniform, but judging by the severity of their haircuts and their cockiness he guessed they were marines."", ""Well, he wasn't surprised. Disappointed, but not surprised."", ""She was too good-looking to be alone on a Saturday night. She'd been merely biding her time until her date showed up."", ""Even if she had come to the fair alone, she wouldn't have remained dateless for long. Not at a meat market like this. An unattached serviceman with a weekend pass had the instincts and singlemindedness of a shark. He had one purpose in mind, and that was to secure a female companion for the evening. Even without trying, this one would have attracted attention."", ""Not that he had been thinking about picking her up, Hammond told himself. He was too old for that. He wouldn't regress to a frat-rat mentality, for crying out loud. Besides, it really wouldn't be proper, would it? He wasn't exactly committed, but he wasn't exactly uncommitted, either."", ""Suddenly she stood up, grabbed her cardigan, slung the strap of her small purse over her shoulder, and turned to leave. Instantly the three men seated with her were on their feet, crowding around her. One, who appeared to be hammered, placed his arm across her shoulders and lowered his face close to hers. Hammond could see his lips moving; whatever he was saying to her made his companions laugh uproariously. She didn't think it was funny. She averted her head, and it appeared to Hammond that she was trying to extricate herself from an awkward situation without causing a scene. She took the serviceman's arm and removed it from around her neck and, smiling stiffly, said something to him before once again turning as though to leave."", 'Not to be put off, and goaded by his two friends, the spurned one went after her. When he reached for her arm and pulled her around again, Hammond acted.', 'Later, he didn\'t remember crossing the dance floor, although he must have practically plowed his way through the couples now swaying to a slow dance, because within seconds he was reaching between two of the muscle-bound, hard-bellied marines, shoving the persistent one aside, and hearing himself say, ""Sorry about that, honey. I ran into Norm Blanchard and you know how that son-of-a-gun can talk. Lucky for me, they\'re playing our song.""', 'Curving his arm around her waist, he drew her out with him onto the dance floor.', '* * *', '""You got my instructions?""', '""Yes, sir, Detective. No one else comes in, no one leaves. We\'ve sealed off all the exits.""', '""That includes everybody. No exceptions.""', '""Yes, sir.""', ""Having made his orders emphatic, Detective Rory Smilow nodded to the uniformed officer and entered the Charles Towne Plaza through the hotel's main doors. The staircase had been touted by numerous design magazines to be an architectural triumph. Already it had become the signature feature of the new complex. Epitomizing southern hospitality, two arms of wide steps swept up from the lobby floor. They seemed to be embracing the incredible crystal chandelier, before merging forty feet above the lobby to form the second-story gallery."", 'On both levels of the lobby policemen were mingling with hotel guests and employees, all of whom had heard by now that there had been what appeared to be a murder on the fifth floor.', 'Nothing created this kind of expectant atmosphere like a killing, Smilow thought as he assessed the scene.', 'Sunburned, perspiring, camera-toting tourists milled around, asking questions of anyone in authority, talking among themselves, speculating on the identity of the victim and what had provoked the murder.', 'In his well-tailored suit and French cuff shirt, Smilow was conspicuously overdressed. Despite the sweltering heat outside, his clothing was fresh and dry, not even moist. An irritated subordinate had once asked beneath his breath if Smilow ever sweated.

Public Service Values;"['Review', '""Public service values are the heart of public organizations; they anchor organizational culture and motivation and guide behavior.

In his new novel, Tom Williams has created two shrewd cats who conspire to sabotage the presidential campaign of a conniving, villainous and extremely wealthy U.S. senator. Will they succeed?', ""Meet Napoleon and Mr. Grover, the feline protagonists of The Politicats. Mr. Grover, a cynical elderly cat, allows Governor Goodfellow to share the governor's mansion with him, but is not excited when the governor decides to run for the U.S. presidency. The cat changes his mind, however, when he meets the governor's opponent: Mr. Grover recognizes him as the scoundrel who many years before took him from an animal shelter with plans to vivisect him."", ""The old cat meets an ally in the aristocratic Napoleon, whose human, a Washington newspaper reporter, is hired to handle media relations for the governor. The two cats agree that the country would be a disaster for animals in general and for cats in particular with the despicable Senator Durth in the White House. Together they hatch an unlikely scheme to disrupt the senator's campaign and insure that he loses the election.

Nice Girls Just Don't Get It: 99 Ways to Win the Respect You Deserve, the Success You've Earned, and the Life You Want;"['Amazon.com Review', 'Q&A with Lois Frankel and Carol Frohlinger', '© Rob Reiter Photography', 'In', 'Nice Girls Just Don’t Get It', 'you compare nice girls and winning women. What are the differences?', 'Nice girls put everyone else’s needs before their own. They hesitate to take action because they don’t want to make waves or be labeled a bitch, and they don’t ask for what they want so as not to appear high maintenance. Winning women factor their needs in with those of others. They know how to approach confrontations without being confrontational and they are willing to take risks in diplomatically asking for what they’ve earned, deserve, or want.', 'What are some of the most common mistakes women make when it comes to getting the things they most want in life and why do they make them?', '1. Not knowing what they want! Women have been socialized to put others needs before their own, so frequently they can’t put a figure on exactly what it is they do want, or are afraid to express it for fear that others will see them as greedy or needy.', '2. Not knowing when it’s time to walk away from a bad situation. Women often think they can turn it around or that it’s their fault, when in fact neither is true.', '3. Communicating indirectly. They expect others to read their minds, use so many words when expressing themselves that others tune out or can’t figure out what they really want, and put their assertions in the form of questions. All of these behaviors contribute to unclear and diluted messages.', 'Why are men often better negotiators than women?', 'The reasons are complicated. Women are as good as men when they are negotiating on behalf of others (such as their families) but fall short when they are negotiating for themselves, for example, when they negotiate salary.', 'Nice girls have a particularly difficult time as negotiators because they tend to accept the rules as they are, failing to recognize they can challenge the status quo. Take the all-too-common situation of the woman who holds down a job and then heads home for the “second shift.” She fails to recognize the opportunity to negotiate a more equitable solution with her family--she’s not the only person who’s capable of sorting laundry and grocery shopping!', 'When you look at high-profile contemporary women, who do you see getting it right?', 'People like Anne Mulcahy at Xerox, actor Sandra Bullock, and media mogul Oprah Winfrey are all getting it right. They haven’t sacrificed their femininity to get what they want, and they don’t suffer fools gladly. Each is a unique combination of the characteristics that make up the personalities of winning women.', 'Give us three tips women can put to immediate use to start getting what they want--now!', '1. Define with crystal clarity what it is you want that you don’t currently have. It could be a better job, to leave a bad relationship, or to tell your mother-in-law to butt out of your business. Until you can “see” and “say” what you want, you won’t get it.', '2. Speak in headlines with taglines. The first thing out of your mouth should be your main point, not a lot of filler words. Give your opinion briefly and succinctly. Then follow it up with an inclusive tagline such as, “You can see I have strong feelings about this. I’d also like to know what you think.” The tagline mitigates the impression of being too aggressive.', '3. Avoid V-8 moments. Rather than walk away from difficult conversations thinking, “I should have said __________,” prepare in advance for resistance. If you know your husband will be resistant to you going back to work, consider what his objections might be and have a response ready.', 'From Publishers Weekly', 'Frankel (Nice Girls Don\'t Get the Corner Office) and Frohlinger (coauthor, Her Place at the Table) provide a broad set of skills women can use to achieve goals when dealing with anyone, anywhere, whether a disparaging sister-in-law, a contractor who can\'t remember what was agreed upon in previous discussions, or a boyfriend who lets you pay for most of the meals and entertainment. Employing case studies and self-assessment and visualization exercises, the authors urge readers not to let early experiences define them and limit their expectations of themselves or invest equally in every relationship. They advise paying attention to subtle messages given by others, developing a thicker skin, and asking directly for what you need rather than hinting around, as well as avoiding passive-aggressive behavior; learn to interrupt a discussion ""with aplomb""; and being proactive in both your personal and professional lives.

Eagle Blue: A Team, a Tribe, and a High School Basketball Season in Arctic Alaska;"['From Publishers Weekly', 'Starred Review.', 'Eight miles above the Arctic Circle, there\'s a village with no roads leading to it, but a high school basketball tradition that lights up winter\'s darkness and a team of native Alaskan boys who know ""no quit."" D\'Orso (coauthor of', 'Like No Other Time', 'with Tom Daschle) follows the Fort Yukon Eagles through their 2005 season to the state championship, shifting between a mesmerizing narrative and the thoughts of the players, their coach and their fans. What emerges is more than a sports story; it\'s a striking portrait of a community consisting of a traditional culture bombarded with modernity, where alcoholism, domestic violence and school dropout rates run wild. One player compares Fort Yukon to a bucket of crabs: ""If one crab gets a claw-hold on the edge... and starts to pull itself out, the others will reach up and grab it and pull it back down."" Among D\'Orso\'s unusual characters are the woman who built a public library in her home, the families who adopt abandoned children, and, of course, the boys for whom ""hard"" has an entirely different meaning (e.g., regularly trudging through ""icy darkness"" to board flights to Fairbanks for games). With a ghostlike presence, D\'Orso lends a voice to a place that deserves to be known.', '(Mar.)', 'Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Gwich\'in are Indians, not Eskimos or Inuit; though nowadays many of them are children or grandchildren of interracial marriages, they are related to the Navajo and the Apache. Their town lies just inside the Arctic Circle, 150 miles northeast of Fairbanks, Alaska, and in 2004 their high school had an enrollment of 32. Fort Yukon is not free of the alcoholism, cultural confusion and defeatism that poison so much of Native American life. ""That\'s one thing that really sucks about life here, [a student named Matt Shewfelt] will tell you straight up. Whenever someone tries to do something worthwhile, to make something of themselves -- and this is true of the grownups as well as the kids -- it seems like everyone else tries to pull them back down.""', ""But the town has a tradition of good basketball, thanks in no small part to coach Dave Bridges, who has repeatedly taken his boys to Anchorage for the state tournament in their small-school division. The 2004 crop showed exceptional promise. They weren't tall -- only two players were a bit over six feet -- but they were fast, with some standout shooters, especially from beyond the three-point line. They had bench strength, and, at Bridges's insistence, they were in terrific shape. (Before the season was over, they came from behind to win more than once, their stamina helping them overtake wobbling opponents.)"", ""D'Orso is such a spirited writer that he could surely make the reader empathize with boys from any of the teams Fort Yukon played over the season, including the one from a town of Russian Old Believers where the people still wear Amish-like garb. But he persuades us that there was something special about these Eagles, a blend of selflessness and maturity that kicked in when the boys took the court. Many of them came from broken homes, or had grown up seeing their once-athletic fathers go to seed, or had themselves already gotten into trouble. The boys might claim that they shot hoops to attract babes, but for virtually all of them, basketball -- with its excitement, its wholesome relief from domestic anxieties, its opportunity for travel outside of bush Alaska -- was the most enriching part of life. Previous teams had come so close to winning state so often that a current of hope seemed to ripple through the cold Fort Yukon air: This might just be the year."", 'D\'Orso ably sketches the mentality of rural interior Alaska: a combination of fascination with the urban world (the sweetest kid on the team affected gangsta outfits and lingo) and disdain for city slickers who think they can just waltz into the backcountry. For example, the players couldn\'t figure out the fuss over Chris McCandless. He, you may recall, was the young man who in 1992 hitchhiked to Denali National Park, intending to live off the land despite his utter unpreparedness. After he was found dead of starvation, two books were written about him. According to D\'Orso, the boys on the team considered McCandless ""an idiot -- the same kind of idiot who\'s been coming up to Alaska forever, all the way back to the gold-rush days. . . . What galls the hell out of the people who live here . . . is the lack of respect shown by these backpackers and hippies and seekers-of-truth who have no idea what they\'re in for in roadless Alaska and don\'t take the time or the trouble to find out.""', 'D\'Orso also has a gift for bringing ball games to life. He dwells on the Eagles\' attempts to implement their coach\'s perennial strategy, which is to force the other team to play Fort Yukon\'s game, not the one they\'ve grown comfortable with. And D\'Orso brings to life the ""run,"" in which a combination of steals, fouls by the other team and a three-pointer or two can propel a team from a few points back to a few points ahead in a matter of seconds. Reading Eagle Blue has the same nerve-wracking effect as watching a real-life game in which someone you know and love is playing.', ""You can flip to the back of the book and find out how the Eagles' 2004 season turned out, but I wouldn't advise it. Better to take each game as it comes, living the season much as did the boys themselves in D'Orso's sensitive, exhilarating account."", 'Reviewed by Dennis Drabelle Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

One thing that helps citizens in the isolated, mostly Native American bush communities cope with the long winters is high-school basketball. Fort Yukon High School had 32 students enrolled in 2004, and of those, 14 boys and 7 girls were on the respective basketball teams. The boys program is one of the most successful in the state: the preceding eight seasons, they won regional titles and most recently advanced to the finals before losing. With the OK of school officials and the players, D'Orso imbedded himself with the team for the 2004-05 season. He lived in a small Fort Yukon cabin, attended all the practices and games, and tried to learn as much as possible about the culture of the town in which the players live. The result is a thoroughly fascinating mix of sports and cultural anthropology. The basketball narrative is fascinating as D'Orso examines the team dynamic, a la John Feinstein, but the real beauty of the book emerges in the contextual portrait of life in a small bush town where the traditions of hunting, trapping, and fishing are slowly eroded by the culture of snowmobiles, video games, and television.

David Copperfield (Wordsworth Classics);"['Review', 'The most perfect of all the Dickens novels. --Virginia Woolf - From the Trade Paperback edition.', 'From the Back Cover', ""'I really think I have done it ingeniously and with a very complicated interweaving of truth and fiction.' So wrote Dickens of David Copperfield (1850), the novel he called his 'favourite child'. Through his hero Dickens draws openly on his own life, as David Copperfield recalls his experiences from childhood to the discovery of his vocation as a successful novelist. Rosa Dartle, Dora, Steerforth and Uriah Heep are among the characters who focus the hero's sexual and emotional drives, and Mr Micawber, a portrait of Dickens's own father, evokes the mixture of love, nostalgia and guilt that, put together, make this Dickens's most quoted and best-loved novel."", 'About the Author', ""Charles Dickens was born on February 7, 1812, in Portsmouth, England,where his father was a naval pay clerk. He received some education at a small private school but this was curtailed when his father's fortunes declined. More significant was his childhood reading, which he evoked in a memory of his father's library: 'From that blessed little room, Roderick Random, Peregrine Pickle, Humphrey Clinker, Tom Jones, The Vicar of Wakefield, Don Quixote, Gil Blas and Robinson Crusoe came out, a glorious host, to keep me company. They kept alive my fancy, and my hope of something beyond that place and time. When Dickens was ten the family moved to Camden Town, and this proved the beginning of a long, difficult period. When he had just turned twelve Dickens was sent to work for a manufacturer of boot blacking, where for the better part of a year he labored for ten hours a day, an unhappy experience that instilled him with a sense of having been abandoned by his family. Around the same time Dickens's father was jailed for debt in the Marshalsea Prison, where he remained for fourteen weeks. After some additional schooling, Dickens worked as a clerk in a law office and taught himself shorthand; this qualified him to begin working in 1831 as a reporter in the House of Commons, where he was known for the speed with which he took down speeches. By 1833 Dickens was publishing humorous sketches of London life in the Monthly Magazine, which were collected in book form as Sketches by 'Boz' (1836). These were followed by the publication in instalments of the comic adventures that became The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club (1837), whose unprecedented popularity made the twenty-five-year-old author a national figure. In 1836 he married Catherine Hogarth, who would bear him ten children over a period of fifteen years. Dickens characteristically wrote his novels for serial publication, and was himself the editor of many of the periodicals in which they appeared. Among his close associates were his future biographer John Forster and the younger Wilkie Collins, with whom he collaborated on fictional and dramatic works. In rapid succession he published Oliver Twist (1838), Nicholas Nickleby (1839), The Old Curiosity Shop (1841), and Barnaby Rudge (1841), sometimes working on several novels simultaneously. The appearance of A Christmas Carol in 1843 sealed his position as the most widely popular writer of his time; it became an annual tradition for him to write a story for the season. He continued to produce novels at only a slightly diminished rate, publishing Dombey and Son in 1848 and David Copperfield in 1850, his personal favorite among his books. From this point on his novels tended to be more elaborately constructed and harsher and less buoyant in tone than his earlier works. These late novels include Bleak House (1853), Hard Times (1854), Little Dorrit (1857), A Tale of Two Cities (1859), and Great Expectations (1861). Our Mutual Friend, published in 1865, was his last completed novel, and perhaps the most somber and savage of them all. Dickens had separated from his wife in 1858. He had become involved a year earlier with a young actress named Ellen Ternan and the ensuing scandal had alienated him from many of his former associates and admirers. He was weakened by years of overwork and by a near-fatal railroad disaster during the writing of Our Mutual Friend. Nevertheless he embarked on a series of public readings, including a return visit to America in 1867, which further eroded his health. A final work, The Mystery of Edwin Drood, a crime novel much influenced by Wilkie Collins, was left unfinished upon his death on June 9,1870, at the age of 58."", 'Read more']";3.95;Charles Dickens (Author);['Books', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics'];"{'Publisher': 'Wordsworth Editions Ltd; Illustrated edition (August 4, 1997)', 'Language': 'English', 'Paperback': '768 pages', 'ISBN 10': '9781853260247', 'ISBN 13': '978-1853260247', 'Lexile measure': '290L', 'Item Weight': '1.04 pounds', 'Dimensions': '5 x 1.58 x 7.79 inches'}";185326024X

All rights reserved.', 'Chapter 1.', 'When I was younger, I consisted of little but my parents\' ambitions for who I was to become. But by the end of ninth grade, all I wanted for myself was a date to the Spring Fling dance. A hot one. The dream was granted, by chance. Finding myself unaccompanied in the final days before the event, I begged my neighbor and childhood best friend, Anita Dayal, to take pity on me. Fine; I could be her ""escort,"" she allowed, putting the word in air quotes as we readied for that rather fateful night.', ""Before the dance, I was set to meet Anita and our crowd at the mall. We'd take photos outside the TCBY, all trussed up in our Macy's finery. My mother deposited me on a median in the middle of the parking lot, early, then sped off to my older sister's picture party. Prachi had been nominated for Spring Fling court and was living a more documentable high school life. Prachi, the Narayan child who managed to be attractive and intelligent and deferential to our cultural traditions to boot, was headed to Duke, we were all sure. Earlier that day, cheeks blooming with pride, my mother had fastened a favorite, slim gold chain of her own, gifted by our nani, around Prachi's neck. My sister kissed my mother's cheek like an old, elegant woman and thanked her, while I waited to be dropped into my own small life, in an ill-fitting suit."", 'I waited on the median, growing anxious. There was no sign of Anita. I paced and fidgeted, watching the others pin corsages and boutonnieres, and readied myself, after fifteen minutes, then twenty, to give up and trek down one of those horrible sidewalk-less stretches of great Georgia boulevard back home to Hammond Creek. I was already turning away from the fuss, attempting to loosen my father\'s congealed-blood-colored tie, when Anita and her mother screeched up in their little brown Toyota. I knocked my knee against the concrete dolphin-adorned fountain and shouted, ""Shit!""', ""A wall of mostly Indian and Asian parents regarded me with a collective glare. Yes, I consisted largely of my parents' ambitions, but some part of me was also made of the ogling, boggling eyeballs of the rest of our community."", 'And another part-a significant part-was Anita, who was now stepping out of the double-parked car, smiling blithely. Anita had bright eyes: muddy brown, lively, roving, liable to flick over you quickly, as though there was something else more interesting or urgent in your vicinity. It made you want to stand squarely in her line of vision to ask for her full attention; when you got it, it felt like the warming of the late-morning summer sun.', '""Neil, I', 'told', 'her we were late, but stubborn girl wouldn\'t listen!"" Anita\'s mother, Anjali Auntie, said. She was dressed like she planned to attend the dance herself, in a bright green sheath framing her breasts, a dress that reminded me she was unlike other mothers.', '""I got invited to Melanie\'s picture party first,"" Anita said. ""I IM\'d you!""', ""A betrayal: cherry-cheeked and universally admired Melanie Cho had laughed off my invitation to the dance weeks before, leaving me itchy with self-loathing. Anita's grin-the grin of the newly anointed popular-matched the crystal studding along her bright blue bodice."", ""Anjali Auntie positioned us shoulder-to-shoulder. Anita linked her arm through mine so the insides of our elbows kissed. This was how we'd been posed in Diwali photos as kids, when our families got together and Prachi dressed Anita up as Sita and assembled a paper crown for me, her spouse, Lord Rama. The posture suddenly seemed foreign."", 'There was no time to be angry. I smiled. In the photos, I am washed out. She, in electric blue and crystal, beams, her eyes settled somewhere just above the camera lens.', 'The dance: People were learning to inch closer to each other, and some girls didn\'t mind the short guys\' heads bobbing below theirs, and some guys didn\'t mind the girls with braces. The teachers on chaperone duty patrolled the bathrooms, where kids who were not my crowd might engage in ""nonsense,"" as my mother put it,', 'nonsense', 'that was inaccessible to me at the time.', 'As with any other event at Okefenokee High School, the room was semi-segregated. A handful of white kids mosh-pitted in the middle of the party; others made their way to those nonsense-filled bathrooms or the parking lot. The good-looking Indian and Asian girls hung by the long banquet table. The debate, math Olympiad, robotics, etc., Indians and Asians were the likeliest ones to be bopping around, because though none of us could really move, the dancing offered a prescribed activity for the evening, a script. I depended on scripts in those days, before anyone asked me to invent my own life.', 'I followed Anita onto the floor, expecting to join the circle dancing around Hari Chopra, who was attempting to prove his B-boy abilities to the Kanye song that was ubiquitous that year, flicking a finger across an imaginary flat-brimmed hat in the warm-up. But Anita veered toward a cluster of girls that included my sister and Melanie. I stopped at the edge of the squeaky gym floor in my dress shoes, which were vast, boatlike, slippery, and made me sweat.', '""Anita,"" I whispered frantically, but she mouthed, Just a second, and darted into the girl cluster-as though she was crossing the finish line in a race I hadn\'t known she was running. She\'d grown spritely and uncatchable lately, always squinting at a secretly looming horizon line.', ""I didn't see my date again until the end of the evening, let alone dance with her. The ghost of her touch on me-the inside of her elbow against the inside of mine-lingered on my skin. I felt insubstantial."", ""I spent the party with Kartik Jain and Manu Padmanaban and Aleem Khan and Jack Kim and Abel Mengesha (who was Ethiopian but clocked most of his time with the Asians), avoiding Shruti Patel, with whom Manu had agreed to come, and whose electrified bristly hair and eager gopher teeth discomfited us. Jack was counting the girls he'd made out with at computer camp the year before, in an effort to overcome the fact that he was here tonight alone. I had been at that camp and knew the single kiss he'd received was dumb luck, the result of a double dog dare."", 'I was supposed to return home with Anita and her mother at ten-their house sat catty-corner from ours in the Hammond Creek cul-de-sac. Ten; I only had to last till ten. I watched the egg-shaped clock on the wall above the banquet table tick. I drank the sugary punch; it stained my tongue Coke-can red.', 'Just before nine thirty, people began to gather for the announcement of Spring Fling royalty. At the swell of a tantalizingly sex-infused slow song-', 'Crash into me, and I come into you', '-I went looking for Anita. I wound through the gym, all elbows and too-long hair that curtained the top of my vision. No Anita. No Prachi. I sidestepped out of the gym and down the hallway carpeted in green and gray-the swampy colors of Okefenokee High School. It occurred to me that I might find the girls in the parking lot. The parking lot, full of', 'nonsense', '.', 'I pushed open the first door I encountered, missing, in my annoyance, the sign that read EMERGENCY EXIT. The alarm wailed. People\'s hands flew to their ears, and heads turned toward me. A white guy gripped a handle of some clear verboten substance. Someone cursed. Someone shrieked. Someone laughed. I stood mute as they scattered. When Coach Jameson came striding outside to bust up the party, he noted my presence, held up a large, meaty finger, and said, ""Wait there."" I froze, darkened by the shadows behind the gym.', 'Girls were crying. Not Anita, I don\'t think. It took a lot to make her cry. From somewhere came my sister\'s voice, in the buttery lilt that never failed her: ""Coach, I just came out here to find my necklace, it fell off, it\'s my grandmother\'s, you know I don\'t drink-""', '""I\'ll ask, missy,"" he said. ""What were you doing to cause you to, ahem, lose a necklace?""', ""I shuddered and didn't catch Prachi's reply because Anita stood behind me, propping open the door whose alarm had at last been killed."", '""Neil, get inside, you\'ll get in trouble,"" she whispered. Her glossed lips quivered and for a moment I was suffused with a premonition that something phantom wished to be spoken aloud but that no one-not me, not the people around me-could find the language. Anita clamped her mouth shut and blinked very fast, as though beating back that ghost, and there we remained, still rooted to our finite asphalt selves.', 'I said Prachi was out there and it didn\'t sound good. ""The coach already saw me,"" I added. ""I\'m not supposed to move.""', '""Are you', 'kidding', 'me, Neil?"" Anita was framed in the doorway as the hallway light streamed out around her. ""My mom\'s waiting, like, right now.""', '""I wasn\'t drinking.""', '""I', 'know', 'you weren\'t drinking,"" she said. No, more like-""I know you weren\'t drinking."" I wondered how she had come by all her new wisdom, how she had grown so fast, so far ahead of me. ""Did', 'you', 'set off the alarm?""', 'I nodded miserably.', '""Dude,"" Anita said. ""People go out the food delivery door."" She pointed. She spoke rapidly, percussively, with a bravado that might have masked her nerves at being so near', 'trouble', '.', '""C\'mon, kid."" Coach Jameson led his small troupe of prisoners inside, beckoning me with that meaty finger, holding the alcohol pinched in his other hand like a used rag. The captured students followed, heads bowed-two white guys I didn\'t know, Katie Zhang, Mark Ha, Prachi. My sister mouthed, What? at me while Coach Jameson looked Anita up and down and added, ""And you, rubbernecker.""', '""I just got here, coach,"" Anita said. Her voice caught in her throat before she switched to a clipped tone like the sort my mother used on work calls. I could feel her straining to be someone with whom she had not yet become fully acquainted. ""Actually, we were trying to leave. My mom\'s outside, you can ask her-""', '""Y\'all well know not to be in the parking lot.""', '""I just got worried, see,"" she tried again, in a slightly sharper pitch. ""Because-""', '""What\'s your name?""', '""Anita Dayal.""', '""And yours?""', '""Neil Narayan.""', 'He repeated. ""Anita Dial. Neil Nay-rannan. Y\'all\'re freshmen?""', '""Yes, sir,"" Anita said.', '""Stay away from this crowd,"" Coach Jameson said grandly. ""Getcherselves home.""', 'He escorted his captured cool kids past us. The scent of our innocence-or mine, anyway-was strong enough to overpower everything else.', ""Some kids my age drank alcohol, but I was afraid to, not because of the things the health class teacher cautioned would happen to your body and brain but because of my mother's warnings that engaging in"", 'nonsense', ""could abort all you were supposed to become, could in fact abort the very American dream we were duty-bound to live out. Take the case of Ravi Reddy, whose parents had shipped him to Hyderabad to finish high school upon smelling beer on his breath. No one had heard from Ravi since, but my mother had hinted that she and my father were not above taking a leaf out of the Reddys' book."", 'I would not have wished such a fate on anyone, let alone my sister, so I said to Anita, ""Can you get your mom to wait two minutes? My sister lost our grandmother\'s gold necklace, and she\'ll be even more screwed.""', 'Anita bit her lip. Something shifted in her posture, brought her into a new alertness, like when she was asked a question to which she knew the answer in algebra.', '""Oh."" She retrieved her pink flip phone from her fake-pearl-encrusted purse. ""Mama. Coming. But Prachi lost this gold necklace, and Neil-"" A pause. She hung up. ""My mom says be quick.""', '""My sister doesn\'t drink."" I held up a flashlight that connected to my Swiss Army knife and house keys. Nothing showed itself on the asphalt, just the black Georgia ground beneath the black Georgia sky. Puddles of yellow lamppost light revealed the riddled texture of the parking lot. There were no secrets here; in this stupid place, what you saw was what you got.', '""All of them drink,"" Anita said, peeling away. ""You can\'t run in that crowd and not drink."" Did', 'Anita', ""drink? A pang in my chest-for wasn't she now in"", 'that crowd', '? ""She ditched with Hudson Long because she knew she was going to lose Spring Fling Princess.""', '""She lost?"" I sighed. Even if Prachi escaped Coach Jameson, she\'d be smarting from defeat. I didn\'t fancy enduring one of her performances of grief, wherein she refused to make eye contact with us for days, or ensured I overheard her vomiting in the bathroom. ""See anything?""', '""Nah,"" Anita called, a little nasally.', 'I cast my light beneath the dumpster, knelt and got a smashing stench of cafeteria chili and old bananas and a number of other smells both animal and human. I covered my nose, stood, ran the beam in a long line like a searchlight hunting a fugitive in desolate farmland, sweep, one, sweep, two, but nothing on the asphalt glinted like gold. ""Nothing?"" I called.', '""Nothing."" Anita was kneeling by the wretched emergency exit door and reaching for something on the ground.', '""Is that it?"" I half jogged over.', '""Nope,"" she said. ""It\'s not here.""', 'I was right next to her now. ""You didn\'t find it?""', '""I just said I didn\'t. My mom\'s gonna be mad; we have to go.""', '""Your mom\'s never mad."" I waved my hand dismissively. Anjali Auntie was', 'different', '-a given-and Anita could not believably invoke her as a threat. ""What\'s in your hand, Anita?""', 'For her fist was clenched, her knuckles bloodless. She looked ready to slug me.', 'Her jaw tightened.

I followed. I couldn't do anything but slide into the back of the Toyota. Anita and her mother sat in wooden silence up front.

Rooted in the Earth: Reclaiming the African American Environmental Heritage;"['From Publishers Weekly', 'As thousands of African-Americans in the Gulf deal with the effects of the oil disaster, Glave documents the bond with nature that has long been part of the black experience. Drawing on Africa and African art, literature, history, and theology, Glave adds texture to her story. Chapters begins with fictional vignettes reflecting the author\'s own journey through her material, a ""quilt work designed from this detective\'s loving labor to reveal the thoughts of farmers, artists and novelists dotted throughout the South."" Passages from Zora Neale Hurston, Frederick Douglass and others gives voice to the community; for Douglass, the ocean signified freedom, despite the many Africans who crossed these waters in conditions unfit for animals. And Anna Comstock, an instructor at Cornell, opened a Nature Study School in 1897 and published her Handbook of Nature Study in 1911, which inspired teachers in the field. Today, Glave points out that First Lady Michelle Obama cultivates a vegetable garden on the grounds of the White House, bringing the stewardship full circle. (c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC. All rights reserved.', 'From', 'Booklist', 'A history of abuse during slavery and sharecropping has bequeathed many African Americans with mixed feeling about things having to do with the earth, the result being a relatively low profile on issues involving the environment. Glave debunks that notion with a history and perspective on an environmental heritage dating back to African religious and cultural traditions through early environmentalists including George Washington Carver. Glave presents the troubled history of environmental exploitation of blacks—many black neighborhoods are often located in polluted environments—against long traditions of nature as a source of sustenance and healing for a people who often had few other resources. Beginning each chapter with a fictionalized vignette to provide historical context, Glave discloses the little-known history of African American involvement in the environment from Atlantic Ocean explorer Abubakari II to Booker T. Washington, who put emphasis on agriculture at Tuskegee Institute. Glave draws on personal perspectives and oral and recorded histories to detail the ways that the history of Africans in America is rooted in the earth. --Vanessa Bush', 'Review', '""This will interest young readers studying environmental history; an important addition for all library collections.""', '—Library Journal', '""Draws on personal perspectives and oral and recorded histories to detail the ways that the history of Africans in America is rooted in the earth.""\xa0 —', 'Booklist', '""I love it!

Zeus, a young black boy enslaved in Alabama, knows the idiosyncrasies and uncertainties of seafaring life. In 1771 Matthew Samford gave his brother, Captain Marshall Samford, the seven-year-old Zeus, to the heartache of Zeus's parents, Joseph and Lois. To these white men, Zeus was just another enslaved child sold off or given away as a gift, simply chattel."", 'The boy begins his travels as a personal servant twenty miles north of Mobile, boarding the merchant ship', 'Pegasus.', ""At first, Zeus's duties are limited to tending to the needs of Captain Samford, who requires constant attention, including grooming, cleaning, and feeding. As the boy grows older, his duties shift to those of chief cook. He is fortunate in that, before he was given away, he had sat in the kitchen with his mother and picked up cooking skills, duties most often confined to women on farms and plantations. Only men compose the ship's crew, so Zeus's cooking skills are welcomed as he supervises the chief steward and steward's assistant in the galley."", ""Blacks are often limited to cooking and cleaning on ships, but Zeus dreams of being one of the few blacks to captain his own ship, envisioning himself at the helm of a vessel cutting through the choppy waters of the Atlantic. He cooks in large pots over the stoves in the blistering galley in the Caribbean's tropical zone. Alternately, when the"", 'Pegasus', 'sails through the cold, dark waters off the shores of England, he finds a bit of warmth by the stove. Thankfully the rolling waters do not trigger seasickness. Zeus stands on the deck in the worst weather with the wind driving rain into his chest. He sees spinner dolphins and humpback whales rising to the surface from the deep Caribbean waters and watches for hours the jumps, spins, flips, and turns of these sea creatures.', 'During his shore leaves in the Kingston harbor in Jamaica, Zeus wanders through the fishing shanties. The fishermen live on the edge of the harbor and walk quickly to their small boats, which are filled with nets and hooks. Wading on the beach, Zeus sees a two-foot parrot fish in the shoals, shallow sandbanks. Its mouth is white and black, and its upper body, from the dorsal and caudal fins down to the lateral line, is a brilliant blue; the remainder of the lower body to the pectoral and pelvic fins is yellow and red. Zeus also spends his downtime sleeping on the white sand, which is covered in seashells and skittering crabs. He sometimes finds extra work like caulking ships so he can earn money to purchase his freedom in the future.', '* * *', 'For this one imagined tale there are many true maritime narratives by and histories of African Americans, such as that of Olaudah Equiano, who braved the Arctic, and Nancy Prince, a black woman who ventured to Russia and Jamaica. Other African American adventurers on the high seas include Harry Dean, James Forten, Paul Cuffee, John Jea, and William B. Gould. People of the African diaspora purposefully took to the Atlantic Ocean currents, including the North Equatorial and South Equatorial, on every manner of vessel from canoes to sloops, men-of-war, schooners, and whalers. According to the whims and desires of whites, others of the diaspora were also scattered across and tossed along the currents that drew ships to the Americas and Europe — all part of the Atlantic slave trade.', 'In', 'Black Jacks: African American Seamen in the Age of Sail,', 'W. Jeffrey Bolster argues that for many seafaring blacks, the ocean represented livelihood, empowerment, and identity, not enslavement and victimization. ""An image of manacled ancestors crammed together aboard slave ships has triumphed as the association of African Americans and the sea,"" writes Bolster. This image of African Americans as victims rather than survivors with power is much different from the reality of black sailors during the Civil War who, Bolster argues, ""were central to African Americans\' collective sense of self, economic survival, and freedom struggle — indeed central to the very creation of black America."" The legacy of black sailors persisted beyond the Civil War to the present: African Americans have continued their seafaring as part of the modern United States Navy.', 'The Atlantic slave trade from the late sixteenth to the mid–nineteenth century spanned the Middle Passage and the Civil War, with its naval battles during the age of sail, and ushered in a nascent maritime globalization through commercial, whaling, and military seafaring. Africans on commercial passenger and merchant ships dramatically and irrevocably expanded the boundaries and meaning of environment as they pushed off from African shores and stepped onto landscapes that were new to them in the Americas, the Caribbean, and Europe. Their travels on the Atlantic Ocean were complicated as they sought adventure, experienced oppression, and resisted subjugation.', 'Seafaring supported a global economic system of mercantilism based on silver and gold bullion in exchange for American and European goods. The labor of enslaved Africans and African Americans supported this economic system into the nineteenth century. From this labor, whites cultivated cotton, tobacco, sugarcane, and indigo that they traded to Europeans. These goods were transported by ships on which blacks were free or enslaved crew members. Black sailors worked in an exploitative and racist economic system in which whites profited at the expense of others.', 'Seafaring blacks were at times victimized, but they also aimed to control their destinies. For example, they served as cultural conduits, traveling the oceans and connecting blacks to one another on land. London was the economic center of the Atlantic slave trade and the hub for information carried by word of mouth and through objects gathered by black seafaring people. Blacks used the ocean as a low-tech Internet of sorts to carry foreign goods and news, including the latest on the abolition movement.', 'Long before the age of sail, ancient Africans paddled and rowed small and large canoes and navigated their own ships on the waters, many of the latter fitted with sails. Africans arrived by ship in Central and South America, predating the Spanish and Portuguese invasion of the Americas and the Caribbean.', 'In the early fourteenth century, Abubakari II, a ruler of Mali, conferred with and was influenced by scholars at the University of Timbuktu who argued the world was round, countering medieval European scientists and philosophers, many of whom supported the world-is-flat theory. Ivan Van Sertima in', 'They Came Before Columbus: The African Presence in Ancient America', 'says, ""Water fascinated Abubakari the Second — spacious, mobile, brooding bodies of water. Water was like stored grain at Niani, for it took a full day for the servants to fill the royal jars in the river Kala and return with them to the palace."" The fruit of Abubakari\'s oceanic fascination was a fleet set to sail on the Atlantic Ocean into the unknown. Abubakari\'s foray speaks to how people, including Africans, were bound by a desire to find and explore new places. The ocean was the means of transport that often took center stage, though voyagers faced danger and perhaps death.', 'Abubakari sent four hundred ships to the coast from Mali, located in the interior of West Africa, via the Senegal River. They sailed westward, crossing the Atlantic for the Americas. It was a formidable passage, worsened since the final destination was Brazil, at a distance of more than four thousand miles.', 'Imagine these ships tossing in the churning waves, the rain coming down from above, blinding the Africans manning the sails. The women and children huddled together in the hold against the storms. Keep in mind that, according to Van Sertima, African ""men were more terrified of the sea than the vast, blinding plains of the Sahara"" and ""the Arabs called the ocean \'the green sea of darkness\'"" as the Africans ventured forward with nothing but the horizon and water stretching ahead and behind. One captain returned to Mali, frightened when the fleet was hit by a storm. The rest of the fleet might have survived and sailed farther, on to South America after braving the storm.', 'Such a setback did not dull the lure of the sea for Abubakari, who continued to gaze westward across the land of Mali to the Atlantic Ocean and the nameless places beyond. He organized a second fleet that he led himself, leaving his brother to rule Mali. As had been true of the last voyage, some of the ships were filled with cargo — enough food and water for shiploads of people on a long journey. Abubakari never returned to Mali, though griots still tell his story through oral traditions practiced today in Africa.', ""Both of Abubakari's fleets sailed the North Equatorial current, streams that flow clockwise, drawn by the earth's rotational pull, beginning in West Africa and ending in the Americas. Abubakari and the other sailors and passengers probably stepped onto the silvery white sands of Brazil. Some may have looked longingly back for a few moments at the azure blue water and the rough surf tinged white with foam, wondering about the rivers, fields, lakes, savannahs, and forests left behind in Africa. Ahead of them, though, was the edge of the vast Amazon basin. Who knows how many varieties of plants, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and insects lived in the forests before so many species were eradicated through the twenty-first century?"", 'The climate was tropical, ninety degrees Fahrenheit at its hottest, with drenching rain that turned to high humidity at the end of a shower or storm. In the Amazon, depending on how deep the explorers ventured in, they most likely saw rainforests, savannahs, and the massive Amazon River with its many tributaries threading even farther and wider into lakes, swamps, and bogs. The length has been measured at approximately four thousand miles but has varied, since rivers shift over time. They would have encountered an astounding biodiversity in the forests — a high of seventy degrees Fahrenheit under the canopy — that included mangrove, fig, palm, mahogany, and Brazil-nut trees. In the freshwaters of the basin were crocodiles, tree frogs, stingrays, and dolphins. Parrots, macaws, and monkeys populated the trees. Jaguars and anteaters moved on the ground beneath the understory of the Amazon forests. Lizards, snakes, katydids, grasshoppers, butterflies, and moths moved from the trees to the ground and back again.', 'Back in Africa, the ancients made short forays, paddling in canoes gutted and carved out of trees for fishing, exploring, and simply traveling in order to trade from the shores. From the sixteenth century, the origins of the Atlantic slave trade, free Africans working as middlemen used canoes to transport to European ships the ""goods"" — their fellow Africans — destined for trade in the Americas. In small vessels, the Africans expertly braved the shallow waters and swelling waves that Europeans could not navigate with large ships. Many different ethnic groups, from the Mandinka to the Ashanti, were forced on a frightening and mysterious voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas under the tyrannical control of whites, including the Portuguese and the British.', 'An estimated twenty million Africans took countless one-way voyages via the Middle Passage, an arduous trip with health and environmental implications that severely rearranged and transformed their lives. Africans vomited because of the effects of the rolling ocean. They suffered — and many died from — the bloody flux, a gory diarrhea. The people were raped, contracting syphilis — at its worst, resulting in dementia and death — from the European sailors. As many as four hundred Africans were chained to one another, head to toe, in the hold of a ship in a suffocating space as high as a coffin and only as wide as a body length. Skittering and creeping about the closed, suffocating hold were vermin like roaches, lice, rats, and mice. Gruel was ladled out into grasping hands and stuffed into gaping mouths in the center of crazed, terrorized faces. The smell was a noxious jumble to the senses — rotted food, body odor, foul feces, ammonia-steeped urine, and congealed blood. The worst were the dead bodies decomposing in that organic stew for days before the whites removed them. Water was rationed and often ran out long before the ships landed in the Americas. Some of the few comforts, if madness had not taken over, were fresh ocean air, the spray of salt water, and glimpses from the deck of whales and dolphins breaking the surface of the water.', 'Some Africans documented their own Middle Passage journeys. Ayuba Suleiman Diallo came from a Senegambian family of Muslim clerics, all of whom were educated and literate in Arabic. Representing his father, Diallo met a British ship at the outlet of the Gambia River in West Africa to sell two enslaved Africans in 1730. Failing to make an exchange that benefited his father financially, Diallo moved on. Though admonished by his father not to do so, Diallo crossed the Gambia River — which served as a partition against the Mandingoes, an aggressive people — where he finally sold the Africans. Ultimately, Diallo himself, adorned in gold and defenseless, was an attractive target; he was captured and sold by the Mandingoes to the British, who were waiting where the Atlantic Ocean and the Gambia River met.', 'As a devout Muslim, Diallo prayed to God, or Allah, the requisite five times a day. His prayers may have also helped ease the emotional strain of being enslaved aboard the British ship', 'Arabella —', 'ironic since he had been selling enslaved people himself. Perhaps he prayed for protection from the crashing waves and churning waters surrounding the vessel. Thomas Bluett, an antislavery advocate and author of Diallo\'s memoir, traveled with Diallo, ensuring safe passage to England. Bluett wrote, ""During the Voyage, he was very constant in his Devotions; which he never omitted, on any Pretense, notwithstanding we had exceeding bad Weather all the time we were at Sea.""', 'Diallo landed in Maryland, an alien landscape, and quickly charmed the whites around him with his education and knowledge of trade. As a result, they allowed him to contact his father to request money to be freed. Bluett later describes how Diallo, upon entering the English Channel, sought to fix his surroundings firmly in his mind for future use as a bridge between African and English culture:', 'By his good Nature and Affability he gained the good Will of all the Sailors, who (not to mention other kind of Offices) all the way up the Channel fhewed him the Head Lands and remarkable Places; the Names of which Job wrote down carefully, together with the Accounts that were given him about them. His Reafon for doing, he told me, was, that if he met with any', 'Englisfhman', 'in his Country, he might by their Marks be able to convince him that he had been in', 'England.', 'Diallo might have believed that having knowledge or experience in common with the Europeans would protect him from enslavement in future encounters. In 1734, Diallo landed where he had begun, in Africa, after sailing the reverse Middle Passage — an exception rather than the rule for the millions of Africans stolen from Africa — returning to his homeland and father.', 'Diallo calmly sought solace from God during his voyage, but Olaudah Equiano had a more mixed experience. Equiano was from Benin, also in West Africa, and was born in 1745. His memories of the Middle Passage from childhood were of being snatched and kidnapped from his home by other Africans and forced to cross the Atlantic Ocean. Equiano says, ""One day, when we had a smooth sea and moderate wind, two of my wearied countrymen who were chained together (I was near them at the time), preferring death to such a life of misery, somehow made through the nettings and jumped into the sea.""', ""Perhaps the fear of open water prevalent among contemporary African Americans has its origin in the Middle Passage, echoes of psychological terror and torture at the hands of whites. I remember when I worked at a university and a staff member was planning a trip for African American teens, to venture out by boat into the Louisiana marshes. He asked me to talk to a mother who refused to let her son out on the water. This was back in 2004 when many of the marshes were in such a state that it was like being out in open water in the Gulf of Mexico. My colleague became angry when I explained that I would not try to change the woman's mind because stories or phantoms of stories about seafaring terrors going back to the Middle Passage might have been handed down to her, causing her fear of open water."", '(Continues...)', 'Excerpted from', 'Rooted in the Earth', 'by', 'Dianne D.

Tilting at Windmills: A Novel of Cervantes and the Errant Knight;"['From Publishers Weekly', 'What if Don Quixote appeared in the flesh, riding backwards on a noble steed and peeking out from under a makeshift helmet at his creator, Miguel de Cervantes? A meeting between the two literary greats is the creaky premise of this novel, but Branston\'s tale takes on a merry life of its own, proving itself no feeble pastiche. A formal introductory letter from ""Cervantes"" himself may discourage casual readers, but the author soon introduces a cast of deliciously human characters and unleashes them on one another in a tale of literary intrigue. Cervantes is hard at work on his masterpiece when his friend Pedro, a buffoonish aspiring merchant with a marked resemblance to Sancho Panza, confesses that the stories he has told Cervantes about a mad old knight are actually true, and the model for the character of Don Quixote is a real man. Cervantes is naturally eager to meet the errant knight, and his wish is fulfilled when the mad and maddening Don Quixote appears to defend Cervantes against an evil poet who is out to one-up the writer with a manuscript supposedly written by Don Quixote\'s love, Dulcinea. Once the old hero and Cervantes are in the same quarters--be it tavern or holy site or both--the dialogue sparkles and good writing conquers evil as true farce takes hold. This is a rollicking, earthy, compulsively readable take-off on the 17th-century classic. Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', 'From', 'Booklist', 'In a truly inspired flight of fancy, Branston has created a fictionalized account of how the comic masterpiece', 'Don Quixote', ""came into being. It's the seventeenth century, and Miguel Cervantes is alive and well, writing and publishing in highly anticipated episodes what will become his masterwork--but there are many obstacles in his path. First and foremost, the character of Don Quixote is discovered to have a counterpart in the real world, a mad knight of a forgotten age who is obsessed with chivalry. The second impediment, a beautiful duchess who scorns Cervantes for his loyalty to an emperor whom she blames for the death of her soldier husband (Cervantes falls madly in love with her). And, finally, the plotting of the jealous Ongora, a scheming, vicious, dandy of a poet who would do anything to see Cervantes destroyed. Fortunately for Cervantes, his own creation, Don Quixote, comes to his aid, and their interactions make this novel an ingenious mesh of fact and fiction that reflects the romance and satire of the original story to which it pays tribute."", 'Jerry Eberle', 'Copyright © American Library Association. All rights reserved', 'Review', '“[A] lively pastiche that includes fine Cervantian comic stereotypes, feisty, foul-mouthed Iberian babes, and a vivid portrait of seventeenth-century Spain.” —', 'The Guardian', '“Very entertaining and at times hilarious.” —', 'The Historical Review', '“There is much here to enjoy. . . . [Branston’s] love of Cervantes shines through this affectionate homage.” —', 'Sunday Telegraph', '“An inventive, beautifully written piece of literary fiction.” —', 'Good Book Guide', 'About the Author', 'Julian Branston divides his time between London and California. This is his first novel.', 'Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved.', 'Before You Go Any Further . . .', 'Some remarks from the author of', 'Don Quixote', ', one Miguel Cervantes, deceased, and an explanation of the present volume', 'As it has pleased God to reveal early in my life His profound mastery over the fate of all human beings, I renounced any aspiration for fame from my writings to fulfill one single aim, that is, to reveal a little of God’s intelligence to his obstinate, graceless, and ungrateful creations. It was allowed, a little, in my long life to reveal some of this in my two novels of', 'Don Quixote', '. But my character, circumstances, and a divine requirement that an equal if not surmounting purity of spirit should accompany any such aspirations meant that this accomplishment could occur only late in life. After the publication of the', 'Don Quixote', 'books, my life shortly thereafter ended, and I had not so much influence on the outcome and development of my novels. Yet new knowledge will produce fruit, even in the desert, and these novels of mine have since been published in many other languages than my purest Castillian, languages I had never heard of. This is a paradox, for many do not understand my books, as they were a hurried creation, and a dying man can only blunder at his final duties. However, as there exists no facility whereby history might burnish its better moments, it falls on a few who receive the inspiration such a work affords to renew the source. These recipients know that it is a task, inherited by every human being, whether they know it or not, that they strive to honor the divine in all things, for it is the promise of God to raise everything after him.And so, humanity has a debt in my favor. For no sooner had the first part of', 'Don Quixote', 'been published, than a dozen paltry and malicious counterfeits tried to take its place. More conflict took place between rival booksellers of these and my works—a war between my purest concept and the influence of unsound and criminal editions—than ever existed between Turk and Christian. In the time that it takes to write this sentence, these shadows of their better—the hidalgo Don Quixote—spurned their pages and, like rebellious children, inclined to dictate their own destinies. Before my creation could be fully rounded, and to protect the content already published, I was forced to write a sequel to the first book that was but an end to one of the choicest of all characters.However, though it suited divine ends that a hurried conception should be followed by a faster end, it was allowed that there must be some resolution to my novel’s inspiration. Therefore an individual has been elected to deliver another addition to my life’s work, intended as a companion to the originals, both in spirit and humor. And as my main character has already found an end, then this freshest episode must make an addition without intruding into the exploits of the noblest buffoon in history. The deliberation of this newest episode is the work of this author to engender.This new author is an individual aloof from my history and origin. His mind has never found a true purchase in a worthy ideal, while his character has the same wildness, uncertainty, and manifest despairs that once afflicted my soul. Yet this flawed pupil is as suitable to the purpose of God as is the sunrise, or the ebb and flow of the sea. Therefore the birth, progress, and resolution of the adventures contained in the following pages have my blessing but not my hand. His heart then must find partner with God, his mind turn the mill of phrases, and his pen enact the spirit of lucid and genial comedy.', 'Redoubtable Pedro', 'Pedro, redoubtable trader, visits a print shop and inquires after the first episodes of a new comic romance.', 'Given Pedro’s ambition to be the world’s finest merchant in traded goods, it gratified him, on his morning walk through the lower quarter of Valladolid—the new hub of the Spanish Empire—to see his neighbors and acquaintances carrying full to overflowing shopping baskets. And further that many of them would frequently and cheerfully greet him by his first name and make a reference to their latest business dealings. Someone might say, “Your eggs made an emperor’s breakfast, friend Pedro, and did you find a worthy pair of legs for those stockings?” or, “Tell your wife and daughters to come for their fittings, friend Pedro, for that lace would be a fortune for any milliner.”Occasionally there would be complaints, but to these Pedro would willingly listen, for he believed that his reputation depended not only on his successes, but also on the speed with which he allowed and redressed his mistakes. And to this he added a firm patience, for he would always have to remind his partners in trading that nothing was for free, and that he required something for himself. If there was any labor involved, for example, harvesting oranges or pulling carrots, this meant “something extra” for him. People liked him, therefore, because he facilitated their needs, he knew everything about everyone without harm to anyone, and he never failed to deliver a little more than what was requested. With a pleasant rough-cast manner and the immediate poetry of argot in his speech, people thought of him as being friendly, fair, and, above all, a genius of surprises.Pedro was not a family man. His wife was a worthy Catholic matron, the mother of six healthy daughters, yet their names Pedro found hard to recall, and their birthdays he never remembered. His body was a mere visitor to his family and home because his spirit was dedicated to his ambition. This was difficult to discern, since he liked to pass the time eating, drinking, and conversing with his friends and acquaintances. When asked about his family, he would say, “The emperor can raise an army, a general can raise a siege, a wit can raise a snicker, but I can hardly raise six daughters, and not one of them thanks me for being their father. All the money I have goes to combs and petticoats. Now, about that row of cabbages I know you have in your garden strip. It would please the parson’s soul, God save him, to have those for an excellent soup that is the speciality of his housekeeper, and is so good a medicine, so it is said, that it can cure winter and bring on the spring. Now if you would give me those to give to him, then he will give your boy Bible lessons and say special prayers for you at Mass. But if you have the mind that your own prayers are good enough, and that the parson, heaven bless his kindness and excuse his feeble wits, can say no more prayers on your behalf than God himself, then he will also teach your daughter a lesson or two on the church organ. Let me come tomorrow morning, and relieve you of the burden of those cabbages!”So in a time of uncertain economy, when the ship could sink or the harvest could fail, Pedro knew how do without the money that nobody had.But there was a Pedro that no one could guess at. In part because he had never fully expressed another of his ambitions even to himself, and because his family, friends, and acquaintances would rather consider him as the cipher of a likeable trader and unwilling husband than as someone with aspirations that were abstract and out of the ordinary. For Pedro wanted to be mayor. It troubled him little that this ambition was inappropriate—a peasant-farmer, recently moved to the city, could never be considered for so high an office—or that the status he sought was so specific; it was not to be rich, to be famous, to be powerful, but to be mayor. How had this ambition arisen? A delighted recipient of several jars of the best olive oil had said, “Friend Pedro, if you wanted to become mayor, I would cast my vote for you.” And as is the case with some casual remarks, it had special meaning, and the idea took root in Pedro with surprisingly little doubt attached to it. It was the natural end, in his mind, to his assiduous work on a thriving assortment of trades and connections. In this aspect of his life there were few disappointments, and this helped him forget the neglect of his family, to ignore the many Masses that were said on his behalf by his wife, and to remain deaf to the caustic remarks of his six—or was it seven?—daughters.On this particular morning, there was much to look forward to, both in satisfaction and challenge, because Pedro was about to visit Robles the printer, the one person who adamantly refused to trade with him, and after that meet with another person, an author, with whom he was enjoying a so far admirably and mutually proffitable business venture, only this time, one that produced actual hard cash.Pedro entered the cool of the print shop from the dusty hustle of the street. The printer’s boy scrambled from a stool, and Robles appeared, trimmed and alert, already in inking sleeves and holding a gathering of papers.“Let me know the figures,” said Pedro, “for I am on my way to my friend Cervantes, and as he lives more by night than by day, I can provide the fire for his inspiration this evening.”“Well, you have your own space in the window, and not an hour goes by when someone does not buy the latest episode,” said Robles. “Look, here in my hand, another dozen gatherings for printing.”“Then let me take money to him as well,” said Pedro, “for he has more debt than a cemetery has stones, and despite his cheerful character, he does have the melancholy.”“I do believe,” said Robles, giving Pedro a small bag of coins, “that success breeds melancholy. You must tell your friend that writing comedies is the saddest activity for any man, and working through nights, with no one to talk to but the moths around your candle, is a sure route to desolation. Tell him to come and have dinner with me.”“I know his reply,”...', 'Read more']";5.99;Julian Branston (Author);['Books', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary'];"{'Publisher': 'Shaye Areheart Books; First Edition (February 22, 2005)', 'Language': 'English', 'Hardcover': '315 pages', 'ISBN 10': '1400049288', 'ISBN 13': '978-1400049288', 'Item Weight': '1.22 pounds', 'Dimensions': '5.9 x 1.4 x 8.4 inches'}";1400049288

Fifth Grade Technology: 32-lesson Comprehensive Curriculum;['Review', 'I have been teaching for 20 years. This year I am in two new schools and was assigned to teach 1st through 8th grade technology. I see the 1st through 5th graders once a week. There was no curriculum, just curriculum ideas. I searched for the first half of the school year and was very frustrated by the lack of coherence in my lessons, and then about a month ago, found the Structured Learning Technology series. It has been a lifesaver for me. Even though I have only used 3 or 4 lessons, it has made my job so much easier. The students enjoy the activities. For me, the scope and sequence makes sense. The NETS standards are on every lesson making it easier to fit into my state standards. Each lesson builds on another. I am starting every grade at the 1st grade level and quickly progress through the lessons depending on skill levels. Students are excited about learning. We are using tools that are available to everyone. There are some software specific lessons but can be accomplished with a comparable software. It is up to date. The students are learning. They are problem solving. They are taking responsibility for their learning and are asking questions. There are less discipline issues because they are engaged. The progression makes sense. I only wish I had more time with each grade. But because I only have once a week, I give them an introduction and then know that the next year (the next series) will expand on the previous instruction. Customer service is an A+. They are knowledgeable and friendly. They are patient. They are prompt. I recommend this series to anyone who is teaching technology. (My two schools are listed below with an email for each school.

Light Bulb Baking: A History of the Easy-Bake Oven;"['From the Author', 'How has a plastic toy oven powered by a standard incandescent light bulb become a cultural icon? Pop-culture pundits often say that trends fade quickly and ultimately make a comeback every 20 years or so. The Easy-Bake Oven belies this notion. Its staying power has been consistent for 50 years, with more than 30 million ovens sold. Nearly anyone born since 1955 has some memory of baking with an Easy-Bake. The oven allowed children to experience the delight of serving up miniature culinary concoctions while indulging in eating raw batter. For generations, the Easy-Bake Oven has taken and continues to take ""playing house"" to a level of realism that is nearly impossible for a child to hope for. The ability to bake and serve real food from a working oven without the supervision of a parent or the fear of fire is one of the most wonderful gifts a toy company (in this case, Kenner Products) has given to youth. I was the youngest in a family of five children and did not have an Easy-Bake Oven to call my own. That honor fell to my three older sisters who, in 1971, were given reign over an avocado-green model (which made for quite a contrast with our harvest gold-themed kitchen). Despite ruling the Easy-Bake roost (and continually telling me that I was adopted--a story for another time), my sisters often let me participate in their baking sessions. I vividly recall peering through the watch-it-bake window, waiting impatiently as the light bulb worked its magic on the just-add-water mixes we had prepared. The results never looked like the pictures on the box, but they were delicious, and they were ours! As I started to pay homage to those memories, this book rather unexpectedly became something more. It became an exploration of innovation, history, economics, commerce, advertising, and marketing. The story of the Easy-Bake Oven is a microcosm of post-war America. It demonstrates how the energies of technical innovation shifted after the war effort toward consumers. It traces the birth and evolution of a new popular culture that celebrated American invention and playfulness while reinforcing family-oriented values and traditional gender roles. On a more personal note, this book also became a collage of many things that I enjoy: nostalgia, an affinity for vintage toys, a heavy dose of baking, and a love of dessert. My hope is that you will enjoy this retrospective as much as I have enjoyed bringing it to life.', 'About the Author', 'Todd Coopee is an award-winning author, toy historian, and entrepreneur.

This was no Johnny. I had my reasons not to look at the facade of the Duke of York's and perhaps that's how I came to notice him down the alleyway on the south side of the theater. The midsummer's late sunlight was almost gone and the play-going crowd was hubbubbing at the front doors, and here was this lurker in the shadows, around the corner, on the way to where only the company of actors was supposed to go. He'd crammed a bouncer's body into a three-piece serge and his trilby hat was pulled down and tipped forward."", ""I gave off pretty much the same impression, I realized, but I wouldn't want to see somebody like me down this alley either. He was turned sideways and looking in my direction, probably thinking similar thoughts."", ""There was nothing to do about it. Sniffing around on the sly for my government while still trying to more or less sniff the same way for my newspaper had made me excessively suspicious of my fellow man. I would have been a busy guy indeed if I'd tried to deal with every mug who put me on edge."", ""The trilby and I stared at each other for a long moment, and then he broke the gaze and slid away down the alley, fading into the shadows. I shrugged him off and figured it was time to go to my seat. Which meant I had to face the wired sign thrusting out over the Duke of York's portico. In my coat pocket was a ticket for the front row of the stalls, so I had to deal with this."", 'I turned.', 'The theater event of the decade, for a limited run only, was ringed in electric lights: Isabel Cobb is Hamlet.', 'My fifty-six-year-old mother.', ""When this ticket showed up on a bellhop tray at my hotel without a note, it took me by surprise. As close as I'd been to the theater all my life, I'd been unaware that the theatrical event of the decade was about to happen in London, much less that it involved my mother. I hadn't heard from or about her for fifteen months. A couple of years ago she retired from the legitimate theater, refusing to carry on in a profession that no longer let her pretend she was a twenty-year-old beauty. She was still pretty much a beauty. But she wasn't Juliet anymore. Or even Kate in"", 'Shrew,', 'which an audience in Memphis finally, infamously, made clear enough to her, summer before last.', 'There would be no older-woman roles for her, by god. She would rather leave it all behind. But here was a clever way around that problem. She was playing the most famous man in the history of the stage. A young man, even.', 'Under the portico now, I found myself on the edge of a gaggle of shirtwaisted women, talking low among themselves, a few with a bit of purple, green, and white ribbon pinned near the heart. Suffragettes, their focus shifted by the war. Instead of marching and chaining themselves to railings, they were starting to drive trams and buses and work in factories. Some of these women near me even gave off a whiff of sulfur from a munitions plant, their hands and faces beginning to turn faintly yellow from the chemicals.', ""As we pressed together through the doors and into the foyer, my mother's name floated ardently out of these voices. Their new exemplar. She was to be a man. To be and not to be, of course. But tonight a man."", 'I sat on the right end of the first row, very near to her as she came downstage, alone and soliloquizing, wishing that her too too sallied flesh would melt, thaw, and resolve itself into dew. I was trying hard to relinquish myself to the illusion of the stage, trying to forget who, in life, this was before me.', 'To my surprise, this was not difficult. Isabel Cobb was indeed a man. She was a small and slim Prince Hamlet, her hair cut shoulder length and died dark blond and worn loose and wavy, as a young man of the time might, being hatless in distracted grief, and though my mind knew how tightly my mother was wrapped inside her black doublet and though I recognized her voice, which was always low and a little husky even as a woman, and though I recognized those vast, dark eyes as the maternal origin of my own, she convinced me.', 'And I wondered: did she convince herself? Perhaps. I heard no tang of irony in her voice as she, being a man, a son, railed against a mother\'s hasty sexuality. And though this Hamlet before me was believably his own man, he and his qualms reminded me of my mother. Not that I shared the prince\'s vehemence. But as he rolled the word ""frailty"" in his mouth like an overripe grape and then named it ""woman,"" stirring the suffragettes in the crowd to a titter, I stopped seeing the play. I lifted my eyes from Hamlet\'s indictment of his mother and looked up, far up into the fly galleries — uniquely visible to the residents of the front row — and to the catwalk there, its pin rail wrapped with thick hemp ropes. The catwalk was empty and my mind lifted much farther than the flies: I stood outside a room at the Gilsey House in New York. Though it could have been a room in any of a hundred hotels or boarding-houses around the corner from a hundred theaters in a hundred cities on the headliner circuit, where one of the great stars of the American stage and her son lived while she worked. The star was my mother, and she was my father too, my Gertrude and King Hamlet both, though my actual father was no king, was not even a ghost, was an unknown to me, to this very day. But what son needed a father with a mother who could convincingly become anyone?', ""This flash of memory, me standing in the hushed and carpeted hallway of New York's Gilsey House, could have been any from a multitude of memories of my childhood or adolescence in any of those other hotels, but in the front row of the Duke of York's it was the Gilsey and I'd just turned thirteen and my cheek was still damp from her kiss and she expected me, as always, to understand that she was about to shut the door in my face and send me away — it had been thus for as long as I could remember — I was much younger than this when I'd first been cooingly sent away from her door — and at the Gilsey House her leading man had pitched in, had given me a wink and a nod and a"", 'Good lad,', ""and her play — what was it? a Clyde Fitch, perhaps — had run a tryout month in Boston where I'd been bid a similar affectionate adieu in the hallway outside a room in the Hotel Touraine with a different leading man, and I liked this Boston guy okay, and I thought he and I would have this understanding for as long as the play ran, which everyone hoped would be at least a year in New York. But the producer canned him before the play left Beantown, and this guy at the Gilsey was a new wink and a new nod. My mother always seemed to have a hasty hankering for her leading men. And I always seemed to be seeing them off together at a hotel door and then turning and walking away. Having quickly learned not to linger, not to listen."", ""All this ran quickly and hotly and stupidly in me from the front row of the Duke of York's, so it took me a moment to realize what I was looking at. The guy from the alley was on the catwalk. Once I focused on him, I could picture the last few moments. He'd eased out slow to a place at the rail. And now he squared around to look down to the stage where Hamlet was finishing his soliloquy, bidding his heart to break, and this guy had a real intense interest in this Hamlet, who was my mother."", 'I had a real intense interest in', 'him.', ""I concentrated on his face as he watched Hamlet greet Ophelia with feigned madness. I wanted to read his eyes, but they were a little too far away, and I wasn't looking straight into them. But the stillness of him, the casual privilege of his pose, made them seem hard, as insolently hard as his stare from the alleyway. Shakespeare and Isabel Cobb faded into a buzz in my head as I focused on this man and on my instinct that he was up to no good."", ""And then he turned his attention to me, casually, as if he'd known I was there all long."", 'We had a second extended face-off.', 'I was right about his eyes. They seemed dead, these eyes. As dead as a bullet casing.', 'He returned his gaze to my mother.', 'I was tempted to slip from my seat — right that moment, with Hamlet tormenting the girl he loved — and go through the stage access door into the wings and find my way up to the flies.', 'And then do what?', 'Cool off now,', ""I told myself. For weeks I'd been sitting in a London hotel room preparing for the next assignment. Necessarily so. But I'd been idle for too long. This guy reminded me what my body had been trained for and primed for. Which, however, certainly"", ""hadn't"", ""been to cause a public ruckus over some lug because I didn't like his looks or his sneaking around."", ""I lowered my face. I concentrated on Hamlet advising his girl to be off to a nunnery and then making a flourish of an exit. A few moments later, with Ophelia still boohooing about her boyfriend's madness, I looked up once more into the flies."", 'He was gone.', 'I let it go.', 'At the first intermission, after Hamlet vowed to catch the conscience of the king, I went out of the theater and down to the side alley and smoked a cigarette there, watching the shadows, waiting for a tough guy in a trilby. Nothing doing.', ""Back in the theater, through to the next curtain, I kept a frequent but fleeting eye on the flies. No sign of him, and now Hamlet was swearing that his thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth. At the beginning of the act I'd have embraced that recommendation. As the curtain came down for the second intermission, I'd finally been able to drift in the other direction. So I went out and smoked another Fatima and kept my back to the suffragette chatter nearby on the sidewalk and thought about how my mother was indeed Hamlet, as it said rimmed in electric light above my head, and she was a good one, neatly balancing the classic introspective inaction with the strength to kill."", ""Inside the theater once more, she held my undivided attention through to the prince's last words —"", 'the rest is silence —', 'and in the script there is but a single word of stage direction:', 'Dies.', 'For most actors who have taken on Hamlet, the rest is', 'not', 'silence. The rattling or sighing or moaning or gasping are considered by the usual tribe of actors to be the sweet dessert to a long night of emoting. I feared for my mother now, in spite of the surprising subtlety of her performance so far, feared for her excesses. And she surprised me once more by dying with simply an exquisite lifting of the face to the spotlight and a closing of the eyes and, thereby, an ineffably rendered release of spirit.', ""I admired her performance, but I did not like to witness this, in much the same way as I did not like her closing a hotel room door upon me. I felt she had left me forever. And with her death upon my mind — for it was hers as well as Hamlet's that I was thrumming to — I lifted my own face once more, to the flies."", 'And there he was. He was watching once again at the railing, and as my mother played at death he leaned toward her and his jacket gaped briefly and showed a holstered pistol on his left side. I wished ardently that I was carrying my own.', ""From the early days of my reporting career I got close to a fair number of criminals. Tough guys, all of them. Tempered-steel tough. But I'd heard a number of them talk about their mothers, think about their mothers, and inevitably these tough guys turned into simpering idiots of a variety of sorts, from weak to reckless."", ""So it was that even as I wished I had my own pistol with me I was grateful I didn't. I felt trigger-itchy at that moment and it was possible my hand would have drawn my Mauser and would have pushed the safety button and would have waited for the slightest movement of this lug's right hand toward his pistol, with the wrong kind of look on his face, and I would have shot him. Maybe not aiming to kill. Maybe just to disable that right arm."", 'Without this option, however, I clearly understood that shooting him would have been the wrong thing to do. At least till his pistol was out and coming to bear on her. And then I would have simply killed him.', 'CHAPTER 2', ""As it was, he didn't do anything but watch for the last few moments of the play. Then the curtain fell, and when it rose and the calls began, he was gone for good."", 'The audience clapped loudly and the rest of the cast came and bowed and lined up on the sides and they joined the applause as my mother appeared. She bounded downstage center and the women in shirtwaists and suffragette ribbons all stood up and cried, ""Bravo! Bravo!"" and my mother bowed deeply to them as a man and then she straightened and flounced her hair and she curtsied as a woman. The suffragettes cried, ""Brava! Brava!""', 'All the while, the rest of the viewers were applauding loudly, some of them rising to their feet as well. As did I. My mother did not look my way.', 'A boy brought roses from the wings.', ""I'd seen bigger ovations for my mother, but the few actresses who'd done Hamlet before had been pilloried in the press and heckled from the cheap seats. I hadn't read her reviews, but I heard not a single rude sound from this audience, and that seemed a triumph to me."", 'I lingered to let the crowd murmur its way out of the auditorium after Mother had finally stopped taking bows and the house lights had come on. Then I crossed before the front row. But instead of going left, up the aisle to the exit doors, I went to the right, up the steps and through the stage access door and into the wings with its smells of greasepaint and sweat and dust burning on the electric stage lights. The actors had all vanished, and squaring around before me was a lanky man in shirt sleeves and bow tie. The stage manager, I assumed.', 'I was ready to explain myself to him, why I felt privileged to go through an unauthorized door and head straight to the dressing rooms, but he immediately said, ""Mr. Cobb.""', '""Yes,"" I said.', '""Would you like to see your mother?""', '""I would.""', '""This way."" He turned on his heel to lead me toward a door at the back wall.', 'I stepped up quickly to walk beside him.', '""There was a man with a gun up on your fly floor,"" I said. ""Are you surprised?""', 'He stopped. He turned to me.', '""A gun?"" he said.', '""Inside his coat.""', '""Yes,"" he said. ""I\'m surprised.""', '""Do you know who he might have been?"" I asked.', 'The stage manager hesitated at this. He was thinking in ways that I could not clearly interpret. Then he said, ""Not if he was in my flies.""', '""And if he hadn\'t gotten that far?""', '""Your mother has fans.""', 'This was no fan.', 'He turned and moved on. ""Please follow me,"" he said.', ""Something was odd here, but I didn't push the point."", 'As we passed through the doorway at the back of the stage wings, I said, ""How did you know me?""', '""Your mother has a picture of you in her dressing room.""', ""This didn't surprise me."", 'I followed him along a short passageway and we cut back at the next turning and entered an enclosed staircase.', 'Her dressing room was on the second floor. The door was ajar and emitting female laughter.', 'The stage manager knocked and the laughter faded.', '""Prithee show thyself,"" my mother called out, using the lowest Hamlet register of her voice.', 'More female laughter.', 'The stage manager leaned his head past the edge of the door to look in. ""Your son,"" he said.', 'I did not hear her reply, if she made one. Perhaps she gestured. The stage manager pulled back at once and opened the door and I stepped in.', ""She sat with her back to her makeup mirror, still in her costume of trunk hose and doublet, the doublet unbuttoned, however, showing a finely embroidered lace blouse beneath, straight from a Mayfair shop no doubt, her own private joke throughout the night's portrayal of Hamlet, a secret assertion of her modern womanhood. She was flanked by four suffragettes, two on each side, their uniform dark skirts and white shirtwaists making them look like a ladies string quartet about to go off to play in a palm court at a local hotel."", 'I stopped a single pace into the room, my hat in my hand. My mother rose. Quite formally, even solemnly. Then she took a step forward and opened her arms. ""My darling Kit,"" she said.', ""I came to her and we hugged and she smelled of greasepaint and mothball camphor and she felt all bones and sinew inside her man's clothes."", '""Isn\'t he handsome, my dears?"" she said.', 'The women simply made little muttering sounds in response, ready for the vote but not for boldly voicing the sort of sentiments my mother was challenging them to have.', 'I focused on her suffragettes, as my mother resisted my incipient withdrawal from her arms, assessing them as she would have them assess me.', '(Continues...)', 'Excerpted from', 'The Empire of Night', 'by', 'Robert Olen Butler', '.

Gardening for wildlife can involve as little as allowing a strip of grass to grow long and tussocky, or planting a particular type of tree or a small hedge. Maybe you just want to grow the best plants for pollinators. It's your garden; it's up to you."", 'PROVIDE WILDLIFE CORRIDORS', ""It may seem obvious, but the first thing to do is physically open your garden to wildlife. You might see your plot as an individual, closed space, but many wild species see it as just one part of a much larger habitat, which not only includes your nextdoor neighbour's plot but could also include the gardens in the adjoining streets. Birds, bees and butterflies should easily access your garden, but what about animals that walk, crawl, slither or hop? Look around and ask yourself, 'how will frogs find my pond, how will hedgehogs access my borders?'"", ""Providing a way in (and out) essentially increases the availability of food and shelter to garden wildlife. A hole under a fence is normally all that's needed – simply dig one on either side. You can also remove the lowest slat of a fence panel. Walls are more tricky, but it's not impossible to knock out a brick or two without damaging the structure. If you're worried your dog might run amok in neighbouring gardens, just make sure the hole is smaller than the dog – reinforce it if necessary. Hedgehogs only need 5in/13cm to squeeze through. Talking of neighbours, why not encourage them to make holes beneath their boundaries, too? A whole street of linked gardens means your local hedgehogs need never see a car again."", 'Choosing Your Habitats', 'No matter how big or small your garden, you can create a variety of habitats for wildlife. Even small steps such as growing a greater variety of flowering plants or composting your garden waste can make a difference.', ""In creating habitats for wildlife you are providing shelter, food or water, or a combination of the three. One habitat may not meet every need of one animal, but it can fulfil some needs of many. For example, a pond provides shelter for frogs, toads and newts to breed, but it also provides drinking water for birds and hedgehogs and a hunting ground for grass snakes. Larger ponds may even attract the Daubenton's bat, which has evolved large, hairy feet for the special task of scooping insects off the water's surface."", 'Outside breeding season, frogs spend the majority of their lives on land, sheltering in damp, secluded spots such as a log pile. They may eat other inhabitants of the log pile as well as take shelter, so this habitat meets more than one of their needs. A log pile is also a good habitat for wood-boring beetles, wood mice and wrens, and all for different reasons.', ""So, if you like frogs (or just want them to polish off your slugs and snails), then it's a good idea to dig a pond, but it's also worth providing habitats for them on land. But if frogs aren't high on your list of species to attract, digging a pond might still be a sensible option if you want to cater for other species."", ""Creating one habitat provides a piece of the jigsaw puzzle of needs for two, three, or even a hundred species. We can fit the pieces together to create a mosaic of habitats within our gardens, or team up with our neighbours to spread it over a wider area. As such, garden habitats can comprise different habitats that appeal to a number of species. You simply need to establish which species you're most interested in attracting and adjust your garden accordingly."", 'Shelter', 'I once spotted a queen bumblebee zig-zag into the garden and squeeze herself into my willow fence a second before the heavens opened. I fetched an umbrella, popped on some Wellington boots and ventured out into the rain. Wet tyres amplified the noise of traffic on the road; people ran into doorways shrieking and laughing; and I stood, a small puddle forming beneath me, rain hammering down on my umbrella, watching a bee.', ""I stayed for a while, barely sheltered from the rain myself, while the bumblebee snuggled up in the thatch. She had obviously been there before; parts of the fence had started to become wet but not the area sheltering her. I went inside, occasionally returning to find her still there, before she moved on. The bad weather had lasted for hours and the bee stayed longer, but she will have eventually risen, sleepily hauling herself out of her den and off on her way. I'd never thought of the willow fence as being anything more than a barrier between me and the area beyond the garden, but now I viewed it in an entirely new light: as shelter."", ""Shelter includes space to hide, breed, feed and hibernate, and can be provided by anything from a pile of plant pots to a purpose-built 'hibernaculum'. Almost every part of your garden may be home to some creature or other; even a well-mowed lawn is home to leatherjackets and ants, and therefore provides food for starlings, blackbirds and green woodpeckers. Even a paved area can be home to worms, ants, centipedes and solitary bees. And a willow fence can shelter bumblebees from the rain."", 'Yet almost every area of our gardens can be improved for wildlife. A bare fence or wall will provide opportunities for insects to bask in the sunshine. Spiders and other invertebrates may hide in the cracks, and mason bees might make little nests for their young. But if we grow a choice selection of climbing plants up the wall it will come to life. Birds will nest in thickets of honeysuckle and ivy, bees and butterflies will feed from the flowers and moths will lay eggs on the foliage.', 'Shelter also includes the following.', 'A Hedge', 'A mixed, native hedge attracts anything from nesting hedgehogs to bees, moths and butterflies, not to mention all the insects that are relied on by other species for food. As well as nesting in, and feeding from it, birds will use a hedge to dive into to escape danger; a bird table placed near a hedge will attract many more visitors than one it in the middle of a lawn with no nearby cover.', 'For the best wildlife potential, chose varieties such as hawthorn, beech, spindle, blackthorn, hazel, holly, field maple and buckthorn. You can add interest by growing clematis and honeysuckle through the thicket, or planting low-growing flowers along the base. Avoid trimming the hedge until late winter and its berries will provide an additional food source when insects are in short supply, and allow leaf litter to accumulate beneath it.', 'A Compost Heap', 'A pile of rotting plant matter is a central hub where bacteria, yeasts and fungi, and worms, centipedes and woodlice help return nutrients to the soil. Because of all of the smaller creatures a compost heap attracts, it becomes a feeding ground for anything from beetles to birds, slow worms, frogs and hedgehogs.', ""A large, open pile is the most wildlife-friendly composting option as it's easily accessible. If you'd rather contain your heap, a slatted wooden box is the next best thing as many species can still access the goods within. Theoretically, a closed, plastic bin is the least wildlife-friendly method of composting. But it needn't be a 'closed shop'; simply raise the bin on bricks so amphibians, reptiles and small mammals can enter and exit easily. These bins can be the warmest of all, so if access is easy, you may attract a family of slow worms."", ""Position your heap in a sunny part of the garden and add grass clippings and other garden waste, as well as cardboard, newspaper and kitchen scraps (including eggshells but excluding dairy products, cooked food and meat). Keep the waste moist, but not waterlogged, and turn the heap to aerate it if it appears to have stopped breaking down. If you do need to turn the heap, try to do so in April, as you're less likely to disturb hibernating animals and most species won't yet have started breeding. But, regardless of your timing, make sure you check the heap beforehand and go in carefully; garden forks can easily spear frogs and hedgehogs."", 'A Log Pile', ""Replicating a habitat traditionally found in woodland, a log pile attracts a huge variety of wildlife. If you have the resources it's a good idea to use wood from local, native trees, but such logs can be difficult to get hold of, especially if you have a small, urban garden. My log pile is made from prunings from fruit trees on my allotment, half of which I leave there and the other half I carry the half mile home to my garden. It's teeming with beetles, woodlice, centipedes and other invertebrates, and may eventually attract amphibians and small mammals. If the best thing you can do is buy a bag of logs destined for a wood-burning stove then so be it – removed from the bag and piled in a corner they will make a wonderful habitat. Partially bury the bottom layer and fill a few gaps with fallen leaves, moss and soil to attract the greatest number of species."", 'A Leaf Pile', ""A leaf pile, too, replicates conditions found naturally in woodland, where leaves fall from trees and eventually break down to condition the soil. While they're breaking down, they provide habitats and feeding opportunities for wildlife, which in turn help recycle nutrients."", 'The easiest way to recreate this process is to gather fallen leaves from your lawn and sweep them under your hedge or to the back of your borders. You can also make a wire cage for your leaves using wooden posts and chicken wire. Worms, beetles and other invertebrates should still be able to access the pile easily, while a gap at the bottom will provide access to hedgehogs and amphibians.', 'Project: Make a Log Pile', ""Your log pile needn't be a messy affair – they can be attractive and interesting to have on display. If you have room, consider making two piles, one in a shady spot and another in a sunny part of the garden. Those in shady corners will remain damp and cool, appealing to beetles, woodlice and amphibians, while log piles in sunny locations will warm up and dry out quickly, providing the perfect basking spot for insects and common lizards. Any wood with bark still intact will offer nooks and crannies to squeeze into."", ""If you don't have a hedge or room for a large metal cage, simply gather leaves from your lawn and pop them into permeable jute sacks (or plastic bags with holes punched in), then store them behind your shed for two years. Hedgehogs and amphibians won't seek refuge in the sacks, but detritivores and their predators will still use the resulting leafmould when it's emptied out on to your borders, and it will give your soil a lovely boost, too."", ""TIP: Sadly, hedgehogs and toads can't tell the difference between a lovely bespoke hibernaculum and an unlit bonfire. Making the bonfire immediately before lighting or even dismantling it and reassembling prior to striking the match can literally save lives."", 'Project: Make a Mini Hibernaculum', ""Hibernaculum: the winter quarters of a hibernating animal It's not as enticing as a great big leaf pile, but little hibernacula like this plant pot filled with leaves can provide short-term shelter for a variety of invertebrates."", ""Simply fill a plant pot with fallen leaves and half bury it in the ground. Pack as many leaves as you can into the pot to provide the most protection from the elements, and angle it to make sure it doesn't become waterlogged. You can provide even more protection by adding a layer of leaves or sticks above the pot."", 'Long, Tussocky Grass', 'Left unmown, a grassy strip will quickly erupt into a busy habitat for hundreds of species. Pollinators will visit flowers that may now flourish, while seeding grasses and dandelions will provide food for sparrows and goldfinches. Butterflies and moths may breed in the long grass and hedgehogs, frogs, toads and newts may use it to find food and shelter from predators.', ""You only need a small strip to make a difference and it needn't be unattractive. Why not make a feature of the habitat, leaving a circle of meadow around a gnarled old apple tree, or cut shapes or a maze for children to run through?"", 'Project: How to Make a Mini Cairn', 'Creating shelter can often help you as much as the wildlife. A pile of stones in your border will provide a habitat for frogs and newts, but it will also bring them closer to the slugs and snails ravaging your plants.', ""There's no real art to this, simply choose some nice rocks or large stones and pile them up in your border. Find a shaded spot so the stones don't bake whatever is sheltering inside, and leave lots of gaps for wildlife to squeeze through. Mosses and liverworts will naturally colonise the stones, but you could speed things along by adding a little soil and moss of your own if you have some to hand."", '1 Make a circle of stones and gradually start building up layers to make a pile. Aim for a sturdy triangular shape.', ""2 Fill in some cracks with a little soil and pieces of moss, to give the pile a 'worn' look and encourage further moss growth."", 'How often you cut the grass is up to you, but do check the area thoroughly beforehand. You may consider raising the blade height of your mower so caterpillars and other insects can burrow into the thatch.', 'Spent Plants', 'In the wild, plants slowly break down during autumn and winter, helped along by frost and snow. Many have disappeared into the soil or the mouths of earthworms, woodlice and millipedes by spring, and new growth conceals any last skeletal remains. Yet, while plants are breaking down, they provide shelter for wildlife such as ladybirds and other insects, which sneak into seedheads and tuck themselves into hollow plant stems or among fallen leaves.', ""Yet, in gardens, so many insects end up on compost heap in autumn and winter, where they might be exposed to damp conditions and therefore put at risk of developing fungal diseases. By simply leaving your borders intact you can dramatically improve the chances of many species making it through to spring – not to mention earn yourself a grand view of birds eating from the seedheads you've left standing. You don't need to leave the whole border as it is – maybe you could just clear space around the edges to plant spring bulbs, or leave one untidy area concealed at the back."", 'Artificial Shelter', 'Natural nesting opportunities for birds and bees are few and far between, so by providing artificial means in our gardens we can directly improve their chances of successful breeding.', 'Bird Boxes', 'More than sixty bird species are known to use nest boxes, with blue tits being the most likely, followed by great tits and coal tits, nuthatches, house sparrows, starlings, robins and house martins. Not only do boxes provide shelter in the breeding season, but birds may also use them to shelter from the cold in winter. Swifts, house martins, house sparrows and starlings are all in decline, so provision of nest boxes for them could make a huge difference to local populations.', ""It's important to choose the right spot for your box, as prospecting birds are unlikely to nest somewhere with strong sunlight, a prevailing wind or where there's a lot of other bird activity (for example, if the box is too near a feeding station). It's generally advised to place the box in a north-easterly direction, but if tall buildings provide shade and shelter from the wind, then you don't need to stick to the north-easterly rule. And remember: birds don't read books. If they don't take residence after a couple of years then move the box to another part of the garden – who knows, for whatever reason the birds might like it there better, even if it's the busiest, noisiest and windiest part of the garden."", 'Project: How to Make a Bird Box', ""Bird boxes are easy to make. Each species has different nesting requirements and no one size fits all, so decide which you'd most like to cater for before you start. It's also a good idea to choose the location of the box before you get to work: do you have a fence post the box will screw into easily, or will you need to tie it to a tree? (Please don't nail it to a tree.)"", '(Continues...)', 'Excerpted from', 'The Wildlife Gardener', 'by', 'Kate Bradbury', '. Copyright © 2017 Kate Bradbury.

All rights reserved.', '$$$$$$$$$$$CHAPTER 1$$$$$$$$$$$ “I Don’t Know Where to Begin” Don’t Bitch Getting Over the Unknown I am one of the fortunate people who really like what they do for a living. One of the main reasons I enjoy my work is that it takes me out into the world. About once a month I travel to far-flung places such as Phoenix (Arizona), Pasadena (California), Fort Worth (Texas), or Fort Wayne (Indiana) to talk to groups of people—often groups of women—about money. My favorite part of these journeys isn’t the half-hour or so prepared speech I get to give. It’s the question-and-answer session that comes after. Some of the questions are always regional (“Is now a good time to buy a house in this market?” or “What do you think of the future of the big national corporate conglomerate that just happens to be based three miles down the road?”). But others are so wide-ranging I can count on them being raised whether I’m holding court in Detroit, Duluth, or Des Moines. Someone generally wants to know: “What’s the best way to choose a financial adviser?” Someone else typically asks: “Should I be buying long-term-care insurance for me or my parents?” But the question I get asked more than any other—the one I get asked every single time—is the following. It’s never first. In fact, it’s often last . . . as if the person speaking waited until the moderator said, “We have time for only three more.” It usually comes out of the mouth of someone who feels a little silly asking it—who prefaces her question with an apology to me and the rest of the audience for being “so basic.” And it goes like this: I don’t even know where to start. I mean, really. I feel like I know so little about my money that I don’t even know where to begin. Can you point me to a book or a magazine or a website or something that can get me going? Sometimes, the floodgates really open, and the questioner ends with the complete truth, confession-style: “I’m tired of feeling like a total idiot about my money.” I have to admit, the person who asks this question immediately becomes my favorite person in any crowd. Not just because she dug deep and was honest about wanting help. But because now that she’s revealed that she’s looking for help, I can do something for her. As I collected—via e-mail—letters and excuses from women around the country about why they don’t take a more active role managing their money, this feeling of total inadequacy popped up again and again. From young women, older women, women with college and graduate degrees, women in the workforce, stay-at-home moms . . . in other words, from all types of women, in all parts of the country. This one, from Rebecca, a stay-at-home mom, is typical: For anything else in my life, I would get on the Internet, read some articles, talk to some people I know, and make a decision. But I’m paralyzed when it comes to money. I don’t even know where to start. Jennifer, a publicist, put it even more succinctly: I don’t know where to begin. This Is Where You Begin You’re in the right place: This is where you start. In this chapter, I’m going to give you a set of tools you can rely on to make any financial decision, to sound brilliant defending why you’re making it, and to quickly get on the road to a richer life. But first, let’s explore why you can’t get started with your money. Rebecca put it really well when she said: “For anything else in my life, I would get on the Internet, read some articles, talk to some people I know, and make a decision.” That, in a nutshell, is how women make nearly every large, important decision. We do our homework using the resources at our fingertips—the Internet, newspapers, and magazines. We tend to be consensus builders so we gather the opinions of the people we trust most: our mothers, sisters, and girlfriends. We take our time readying a case we could defend in the toughest of courts, and then (only then) do we pull the trigger. Most of the time, as we’ve learned through experience, that sort of decision making works fine. Say you’re an East Coaster trying to plan a vacation for your family of five. You know you want to go to the beach in December. So you hop on the Internet and go to a site like weather.com. You learn that at that time of year Florida’s weather is inconsistent but the Caribbean can be counted on for sun. Your spouse wants a direct flight, so that eliminates a few of the smaller islands. You both want a short flight, so you focus in on Puerto Rico. Next you surf to tripadvisor.com to see what people are recommending as kid-friendly places to stay. You narrow your search to a Westin and a Hyatt. Finally, you talk to your friends who have been to Puerto Rico, settle on a hotel, book flights, and emerge confident you’ll have a great vacation. And that’s, as I said, a fairly large, important, expensive decision. You make smaller decisions with confidence every single day. Paper or plastic? Grey’s Anatomy or Law and Order? Coke, Pepsi, or—what the heck—Fresca? You blow through them as though they’re absolutely nothing. If, occasionally, you hit a stumbling block—heels or flats? pants or a skirt?—a little trial and error (or a call to a close friend) does the trick. Why are you able to make these decisions—large and small—with such aplomb? Because you’ve learned, over the course of your life, that for you there are right and wrong answers. Fresca gets drunk in your house; Pepsi sits in the pantry. Grey’s Dr. McDreamy does more for you then Law’s not-so-dreamy detectives. Unless you’re fighting a spouse over the remote, there’s no argument. One is better. One is right. Yet in the world of money—particularly in the world of investing—there are few right answers. Which stock is the best one to buy? Which mutual fund will rise the fastest? People may claim to know (just turn on CNBC and you’ll see a dozen of them within an hour), but no one really does. That makes it tough to get to the starting line, particularly for women. We like to know the outcome before we make any decision. That’s why we not only cook from recipes but prefer that those recipes come from Julia or Martha or Rachael because we’ve learned that we can trust them. We may loooove Tom Hanks as much as we love our spouses, but we’re willing to spend $10.50 for a ticket to his latest picture only after we’ve read a handful of uncontested reviews. Everything from the books we select for our book clubs to the doctors we see for our children gets sliced and diced and picked apart and commented on before we step up to the plate. And women not only need more information but need it to be broken down into small, digestible pieces. Along the way, if we’re not convinced of a particular piece, we stop and ask for help—we’d prefer it from trusted sources. (Figuring out how to get good help is such a conundrum for women that I deal with that matter specifically in Chapter 9.) Not surprisingly, it takes women longer than men to make most decisions. Not just about money, about everything. Men don’t need to know the answer before they tackle the question. They tend to say, “Gimme the facts, gimme the figures, gimme the logic and the rationale, and let me build a machine.” It’s very much a left-brain approach. They work from start to finish, from left to right, from point A to point B. If they like Denzel Washington, knowing that Denzel Washington is in a new movie is enough to make them buy a ticket. If the end result isn’t totally to their liking, they either fiddle with the decision to make it more acceptable or—more likely—figure out a way to defend it, convincing everyone around them (and themselves in the process) that the outcome was precisely the result they had in mind all along. And there are other complicating factors: •The world of money has its own vocabulary. Don’t worry, I define terms—in English—beginning on page 251.) •The world of money is shrouded in secrecy. Some progress has been made, but talking about financial things—how much credit card debt you’re carrying, the size of your student loans—just isn’t polite. If the number is too high, friends will think you’re bragging. If it’s too low, they’ll think you’re asking for a handout. Nobody wins. •The world of money involves higher stakes than picking a movie to see on date night. When you’re deciding whether to contribute to a 401(k) and how to invest the money you’re contributing, whether to refinance the mortgage, whether to accept a new job, whether to buy life insurance, or whom to name as guardian for your kids in your will, money decisions tend to be important, potentially life-changing decisions. And there are no right answers. Of course you’re stuck. The Power of “Good Enough” The logical next question is: How do you get unstuck? Step one is getting yourself to acknowledge—no, more than that—to really believe, that in this particular area of your life, you do not have to be right. Yes, you heard me correctly. You don’t have to be right. Not only that: You don’t have to be perfect. You don’t have to be the best. You don’t have to be at the top of some class. You don’t have to be the smartest. You don’t have to be the winner. You don’t have to prove yourself. You don’t have to do better than your neighbors or your parents or your siblings or your friends. Instead: You have to be good enough. And you have to believe that good enough is just fine. What does that mean in real terms? It means your investments don’t have to do better than the market as a whole or better than other people’s investments. They simply have to do well enough to meet your goals. It means you don’t have to save more or spend more or make more than anyone else. It means you have to negotiate these areas of your life well enough to secure your happiness and make yourself comfortable. You do not have to justify your financial life. Not to the markets. Not to your friends. Not to your relatives. And, most certainly, not to the men in your life who may not understand how you can sit there, perfectly satisfied with your “good enough” portfolio, without reaching for the stars. (Try not to blame them. It’s in their DNA, just as not taking so many risks that you can’t sleep at night is in yours.) I know this sounds foreign. We live in a world where relativity is key to our sense of inner peace. It’s not enough to be thin or smart or funny. You have to be thinner or smarter or funnier than someone else. The problem is, in the world of money this kind of measuring up won’t make you rich. It will make you poor. Why? Because it will entice you to behave in one of two ways, neither of them any good for your wallet. Either you will go overboard in your quest for wealth, taking risks that are both unnecessary and unwise (Amazon at $400, anyone?). Or you will become so convinced of your inability to be richer than the next guy or gal that, once again, you will become stuck. The truly great thing about “good enough”—and the reason it is so powerful—is that it allows you to get to the starting line in a way that waiting for the ultimate, best possible result does not. Take an example that you may have faced dozens of times in the past couple of years: refinancing your mortgage. Say you’re sitting with a $200,000 30-year fixed-rate home loan at 63/4 percent. Rates have fallen to 6 percent. Refinancing now would save you $98 a month—the difference in your $1,297 monthly payment and the $1,199 new one. But some “experts” have been quoted in the paper saying they see rates falling to 5 percent, maybe even lower. Do you refinance now? Or do you wait? If you’re expecting the best possible ultimate result, you are stuck. What if tomorrow rates fall farther? Then you’ll be kicking yourself, won’t you? But if you’re a believer in the power of “good enough,” you forge ahead. And then—guess what? Starting tomorrow, you pay nearly $100 less a month. Over the life of your loan, that means you’ll save $35,314 in interest alone. If you put the money you’re saving into an IRA or other account where it can grow tax-free, at the end of those thirty years you’ll have a fat $147,126 in addition to your paid-off house. Map to a Million How much more money could you save if you made the little changes I’m going to suggest to you throughout this book? How much richer could you be? I want you to see the answers in straightforward numerical terms. I want you to see the actual dollars—and in some cases cents. So throughout the chapter I’ve sprinkled lots of little Maps to a Million. Unless otherwise noted, I’ve calculated returns at 8 percent and assumed that the savings invested were tax-deferred. Follow the actual steps and you’ll see the wealth start to add up. Then, starting on page 241, you can see exactly how fast incorporating a few of these steps into your life really does add up to a million—or more! Refinance a $275,000 mortgage Prior rate:63/4 percent Monthly payment:$1,783 New rate: 6 percent Monthly payment: $1,648 Annual savings: $1,620 10-year savings: $24,997 20-year savings: $80,182 30-year savings: $202,674 If the rates fall to 5 percent—or lower—as the “expert” predicted, you can always refinance again. But what if rates don’t fall that far? What if the “expert”—because in this world of no right answers even “experts” can be off-base—got it wrong? In the world of ultimate perfection, you would lose. But in the world of “good enough,” you still would come out a winner. Who Are You Doing This For? You! My aim is to make you feel like a winner. I want to make you feel better about yourself and your life. But in order to do that, I need your help. The unfortunate truth is that taking control of your financial life won’t work until, like a good diet, you are doing it for yourself. You may be able to lose five pounds for your husband or your doctor. But you’ll keep them off only if you’re doing it for yourself. You can buy a book on money management because it makes your partner happy to see you walking into the business section of your local bookstore. But you’ll read it and follow its advice only if you’re doing it for yourself. Sound selfish? It’s the furthest thing from selfish. Becoming financially self-sufficient is like giving a huge gift to the people you love. It means you will not be a burden to your parents or your children. If you are in a committed relationship, having a handle on your own money makes you a full partner rather than an associate. (And no, having more than enough money to live on doesn’t mean you don’t have to take the reins. Do you think your grown children relish the thought of taking over your checkbook because you never learned how to pay bills during your long marriage? Think again.) You are taking control of your money because doing so will make you feel happier and smarter, more confident, more content, and more useful. Having a little extra money in your wallet will not make you feel more satisfied with your life. What you do with the extra money will do that. Having better control of that money, however, will make a huge difference in how you view yourself and your place in the world. The folks at Real Simple magazine did a study in which they asked women to describe in a word or two what they’d need to feel successful. Here is what the respondents said: Happiness80% Peace of mind75% Fulfillment71% Self-confidence71% Freedom70% Balance70% Learning to manage your own money can help you achieve about every one of those line items. For JoAnn, who is 68 and retired, it did precisely that. Here is her story: During my growing-up years, there was very little money to manage. At the age of 10, I asked my parents to give me the money that they would have spent on my clothes and allow me to do my own purchasing. I was unhappy with the things my mother bought for me in a very low-end department store in Detroit. I felt that I could do a better job. I found I could buy three semi-attractive outfits instead of the six cheaper ones that my mother purchased. Each year, I added a few better things and even managed to snag a much-lusted-after cashmere sweater on sale. I was very proud. Lack of money continued into my married years, this time accompanied by bill collectors. It was a time of minimum payments on credit cards and trying to meet the needs of the children. And it was very depressing and stressful for the whole family. I took a minimum-wage job when the youngest child went to kindergarten. The job had health benefits and a pension to make up for the low salary. My husband felt that every cent I earned was needed to reduce our debt and run our family. I made a decision on my own, however, and signed up at work to purchase a $25.00 U.S. Savings Bond every two weeks. Each time I was promoted or received a raise, I invested most of that money in more and higher-denomination bonds. Over the years, I quietly accumulated the unimaginable (to me) sum of $100,000. My husband and I managed, through both of our jobs, to resolve our money problems and shortages. Today, the bonds are untouched in a safety deposit box for use in case of an unexpected major expense or a future big surprise for the kids! It was a difficult time for me, and I never want to be poor again. In recent years, I have left most of the money management to my husband. I am knowledgeable about my life-time pension, I know when the Social Security checks are direct-deposited, and I know where our money is invested. And I also know I could carry on financially in the future if I had to. Can you imagine: $100,000-plus on $25 twice a month. Yet JoAnn did it. How? By taking control of her life. By taking control and starting to save even when her husband thought the money would be better spent in other ways. By doing what she knew was the right thing for herself, her future, and her kids. And how did managing her own money make JoAnn feel? “Very proud,” she said. JoAnn had every right to feel proud. And you can feel that way, too.', 'Read more']";15.0;Jean Chatzky (Author);['Books', 'Business & Money', 'Business Culture'];"{'Publisher': 'Currency; Reprint edition (March 11, 2008)', 'Language': 'English', 'Paperback': '304 pages', 'ISBN 10': '0307341534', 'ISBN 13': '978-0307341532', 'Item Weight': '7.8 ounces', 'Dimensions': '5.2 x 0.7 x 8 inches'}";0307341534

Diary of a Monster's Son;"['From School Library Journal', ""Grade 2-4-Bradley Fentriss describes life with his father, who is far from ordinary. In fact, he is a large, hairy monster with fangs and claws. Though his appearance is alarming, in all other ways he is a gent who is punctiliously polite to everyone and a loving father to his son. Bradley's diary entries are arranged into five chapters that detail buying school clothes, Parent-Teacher night, trick-or-treating, home repairs, and a winter picnic. While the events are rather tame, a monster dad gives them an unusual, often humorous twist. Conford taps into the popularity of horror fiction but with a light touch. While at times her message that behavior matters more than looks gets somewhat muddled, it is clear that Mr. Fentriss is liked by everyone who knows him. However, the diary format doesn't fit the narrative: all of the entries are told in the present tense and rely heavily on dialogue. Neither Bradley nor his father comes across as a fully drawn character, but the relationship between them is warm and funny. Newsom's eye-catching jacket and full-page pen-and-ink illustrations will attract and hold young readers. While this is not Conford at her best, children will be drawn by the premise of the story and find the father-son relationship appealing."", 'Maggie McEwen, Coffin Elementary School, Brunswick, ME', 'Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.']";1.18;Ellen Conford (Author);"['Books', ""Children's Books"", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life']";"{'Publisher': 'Little, Brown; First Edition (April 1, 1999)', 'Language': 'English', 'Hardcover': '80 pages', 'ISBN 10': '0316152455', 'ISBN 13': '978-0316152457', 'Reading age': '3 - 8 years', 'Lexile measure': '560L', 'Grade level': 'Preschool - 2', 'Item Weight': '9.6 ounces', 'Dimensions': '6 x 0.5 x 9 inches'}";0316152455

All rights reserved.', ""Most people today believe that to be slim is necessarily to be healthy. They are mistaken: Most diets are so unhealthy as to be useless in the long run. In fact, most diets aren't even useful in the short run, even for weight loss, because the lost weight invariably comes right back.Occasionally, a diet will work for some lucky dieter. But for every dieter who loses weight, there are hundreds more who fail. And no one ever explains why a diet works, when it does, or why it fails.The Body Type Diet answers these questions. Body Type Dieting is not just another peel-away-the-pounds fad. Rather, it is a systematic medical program relating different types of diet to different types of body, in order to enable each individual to find the diet that will be effective, safe, and healthy for him or her."", 'HOW I DISCOVERED THE IMPORTANCE OF BODY TYPES', 'I developed the concept of the Body Type Diet and Lifetime Nutrition Plan more than twenty years ago, when I was a young doctor with a busy general practice. Unlike medical specialists, who focus their attention on one system of the body or another, I was a generalist, accustomed to looking at my patients as whole people in whom all parts of the body have to work together for health. Naturally one of the problems often presented to me was the problem of overweight, and I was often asked for advice about diet. Since the importance of maintaining one\'s ideal weight is, from a health standpoint, beyond dispute, I determined to find a way to help my patients achieve this goal.But I was not fully satisfied with any of the diets available at that time. What struck me was that while one or two patients would lose weight on one or the other of the many popular diets that exist in the marketplace, most of them either failed to lose, or lost weight and quickly gained it back.I decided to take a closer look at those of my patients who did lose weight successfully, and to isolate those factors that were the keys to success.Two patients who happened to come to my office on the same day, illustrated clearly what I discovered. The two were both women, good friends who had decided to diet together for mutual reinforcement. Both had managed to lose about nine pounds; one wanted to lose six more, the other sixteen more pounds. Both had been on a popular diet that was low in protein and fats and high in complex carbohydrates. But there the similarity ended.The first patient, whom I will call Anna, was the one within six pounds of her weight goal, and she looked very well. She had lost her weight from the right places--her hips and thighs, rather than her face, which had never been fat. She told me that she felt healthy and vigorous even though she was dieting, and she looked that way, too.The second patient, Joanne, was a contrast to Anna in almost every way. She retained ""pockets"" of fat on her outer thighs, which, she told me, she\'d been unable to lose. Her face was gaunt and she had a pasty, unhealthy color. Moreover, she was having difficulty sticking to her diet, and was constantly suffering from an intense craving for sweets.What was particularly interesting to me was that both women had followed exactly the same diet. I knew them both, and was confident that Joanne had not been ""cheating""; she was highly motivated to lose weight. Obviously, the difference was not in the diet but in the dieter, or rather in the interaction of dieter and diet. The way the diet worked for Anna was obviously not the way it worked for Joanne.Examining the two women, I discovered that their bodies were indeed very different. Anna had a very steady, strong metabolism. She had excellent digestion, was active all day, and had relatively little variation in her energy level. Joanne was a very different type; she was livelier than Anna, but more given to ups and downs in energy. She had intense nervous energy, but tended to ""crash"" in the late afternoon if she wasn\'t careful. She drank a lot of coffee and diet cola to keep herself going. In short, she was more high-strung and more delicate than Anna.I decided to put Joanne on a completely different diet from the high-carbohydrate one that had seemed to work for Anna. The diet I selected was high in protein, lower in carbohydrates, and eliminated all caffeine drinks. The idea of this diet was to provide a steadying balance for her delicate, high-strung system. Meanwhile, I told Anna to continue as she had been, until she had lost the rest of her excess weight.To my delight, Joanne responded beautifully to her changed program. After just a week on the diet she began to look healthier. Her face, which had been so gaunt, filled out and her cheeks were rosy. But more important to her, she began to lose the pockets of fat on her thighs. Within four weeks she had lost the entire sixteen pounds. Five years after that memorable month, she was still at her ideal weight.Anna, meanwhile, continued on her high-carbohydrate diet and by the end of the next week she had lost her remaining six pounds. Now both women had dieted successfully--but on diets that, like their metabolisms, were diametrically different.The conclusion reached from Joanne, Anna, and thousands of other patients over the years was that success in dieting depends on the particular character of the dieter\'s metabolism. If this vital factor is not considered, the diet will inevitably fail. Without a system for determining what type of body a dieter has, dieters and their physicians alike are at the mercy of chance and guesswork.', 'THE FOUR BODY TYPES', 'Individuals process foods differently--this much is common knowledge. We have all observed that some people can eat much more than others without gaining weight. Also, some people need more of different kinds of food--more protein, more carbohydrates, or more fats. And some people are affected adversely by foods that other people tolerate well.These facts are indications of a vitally important truth: Each person has his or her body type, based upon how food is metabolized in the body. There are a number of traditional systems for classifying individuals according to body type. Perhaps the best known is the classification into ectomorph (the slim, rangy person), endomorph (the rounder, plumper person), or mesomorph (the thicker, more muscular person), developed by Dr. William Sheldon in his book', 'The Atlas of Man', '. The limitation of this system is that it is purely descriptive; it doesn\'t tell why a person is slim, round, or muscular.Another system is that used in classical Chinese medicine, which classifies bodies according to which of the five ""elements"" (earth, water, fire, air, or ether) predominates. While this system has a good deal of value and is useful in certain courses of treatment, I wanted to find one that would be both highly accurate and easier to use. The same consideration applied to the Ayurvedic or classical Indian system, in which individuals are classified into types according to their balance of', 'doshas,', 'or elements:', 'vata, pitta,', 'and', 'kapha.', 'Again, Ayurveda is a highly refined and developed system of medicine, but it requires years of study to use correctly. I wanted a system that would use recognizable Western terms, be in full agreement with my scientific and medical knowledge about the body, and be readily understandable by lay person and physician alike. In short, I wanted a system that would prescribe the right diet while accurately describing the body type.I set about to develop such a system. I began to classify individuals according to which of their four major glands--the pituitary gland, the thyroid gland, the adrenal glands, and the gonads or sex glands--was most active, or dominant, in their metabolism. According to this system, I could then classify a person as a ""Pituitary Type,"" a ""Thyroid Type,"" an ""Adrenal Type,"" or a ""Gonadal Type.""The inspiration for my system of body types came from Henry Bieler, M.D., a great physician and nutritionist, and author of Food Is Your Best Medicine. Dr. Bieler shows in this book how it is possible to distinguish between individuals with a dominant thyroid and a dominant adrenal gland on the basis of fairly obvious physical characteristics. Dr. Bieler\'s ""thyroid type"" is slender, fine-boned, long-limbed--much like the classic ectomorph. His ""adrenal type"" is squarer in shape, thicker and more solid, and closely resembles the classic mesomorph. Dr. Bieler also suspected that there might be a third body type, the pituitary type, but he was not certain of this and did not fully define what this type would look like.', 'Read more']";18.0;Elliot D.

Typical: Short Stories;"['From Library Journal', 'Having a first novel ( Edisto , LJ 3/15/84) nominated for an ABA award is a hard act to follow, but Powell\'s subsequent works continue to establish his reputation as a literary wordsmith of the first order. Typical is anything but a typical collection of short stories--it\'s a dazzling display of verbal pyrotechnics and literary lunacy, mordantly outrageous Southern Gothic wit, and incidents that transcend reality and take on an irrepressible logic of their own. The title story, selected for The Best American Short Stories of 1990 , is a gem of modern madness played out by a down-and-out Texas realist. ""The Winnowing of Mrs. Schuping"" is a Florida-based love story unlike any other romantic tale, yet the characters are so real and true that they linger in the mind. Powell rises above the easily applied label ""Southern writer""; he is a brilliant crafter of words. Recommended.', '- Judith F. Bradley, Acad. of the Holy Cross Lib., Kensington, Md.', 'Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.', 'From Kirkus Reviews', ""This first collection by the author of Edisto and A Woman Named Drown is an odd and arresting mix of full-length stories and lots of little pieces--none of them conventional by any means, and all of them typical of Powell's goofy, southern-inflected lust for language. Powell's snippets include a number of fractured profiles of strange people and places gone weird. There are: ``Dr. Ordinary'' and his litany of the things he finds odious; ``General Rancidity,'' hated all over his military base because ``only the truly rancid themselves could run with him''; ``Mr. Nefarious,'' who smiles about his girlfriend and a fancy outdoor bench; ``Mr. Desultory,'' who gives in to regression because he cannot do things in succession; and ``Miss Resignation,'' who loses at Bingo so much she decides to smoke the cards. Powell clearly agrees with the notion voiced here that ``character is nothing but warts.'' Place fares poorly too: ``Kansas'' is defined by the absence of farming; ``Texas'' is a list of things done and some know-nothing aphorisms; ``South Carolina'' finds the pickup-driving narrator molesting a belle at a fancy cotillion; and ``Florida'' is a drunk lament about what used to be. In Powell's mordant and absurd world, you watch a flood (``Flood'') and a body floats into your arms; you work as a roofer and your buddy decapitates himself in a fall on the job (``Wayne's Fate''); you ramble and drink in the woods, and someone offers perversion (``Proposition''). Faulknerian style and subject come in for some direct ribbing. ``Wait'' sidetracks a rococo turn about a bulldog and a corncob with some plain talk; and ``Lebove and Son,'' a postscript to The Hamlet, considers the consequences of literary revelation. Not quite so academic, but metafictional in their own bizarre way, are ``Mr. Irony,'' a tale of ``low-affect living edged with self-deprecating irony''; and ``Mr. Irony Renounces Irony,'' the confessions of a style abuser. The much- reprinted title story is the narrative of a true underground man, an admitted ``piece of crud'' and unemployed steelworker who thinks he's just ``Typical.'' Lyrically intense and full of the surreal juxtapositions you find in the flotsam of floodwaters: stories at once edgy and exuberant. --"", 'Copyright ©1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

All rights reserved.', 'Chapter 1So, it\'s a little before ten a.m. and I\'m just starting to get a good buzz going. Theoretically, I should be in Algebra II, but in reality I\'m cruising over to my beautiful fat girlfriend Cassidy\'s house. She ditched school to get her hair cut and needs a ride because her parents confiscated her car keys. Which I guess is a little ironic considering that they\'re punishing her for ditching school with me last week.Anyway, I have this sweet February morning stretching out in front of me, and I\'m like, Who needs algebra? So what if I\'m supposed to be trying to boost the old grades up before I graduate in May? I\'m not one of these kids who\'s had their college plans set in stone since they were about five. I don\'t even know when the application deadlines are. Besides, it\'s not like my education is some kind of priority with my parents. They quit keeping track of my future when they divorced, and that was back in the Precambrian Era. The way I figure it, the community college will always take me. And who says I need college anyway? What\'s the point?Beauty\'s all around me right here. It\'s not in a textbook. It\'s not in an equation. I mean, take the sunlight--warm but not too brash. It\'s not like winter at all. Neither was January or December for that matter. It\'s amazing--we couldn\'t have had more than one cold week all winter. Listen, global warming\'s no lie. Take last summer. You want to talk about getting a beating from the heat. Last summer was a hardcore pugilist. I mean, burn-you-down-to-the-roots-of-your-hair hot. It\'s like Cassidy says--global warming\'s not for lightweights.But with this February sun, see, the light\'s absolutely pure and makes the colors of the sky and the tree limbs and the bricks on these suburban houses so clean that just looking at them is like inhaling purified air. The colors flow into your lungs, into your bloodstream. You are the colors.I prefer drinking my whisky mixed, so I pull into a convenience store for a big 7UP, and there\'s this kid standing out front by the pay phone. A very real-looking kid, probably only about six years old--just wearing a hoodie and jeans, his hair sticking out every which way. Not one of these styling little kids you see in their brand-name outfits and their TV show haircuts, like they\'re some kind of miniature cock daddy. Of course, they wouldn\'t know what to do with a girl if she came in a box with the instructions on the lid like Operation or Monopoly, but they have the act down.Right away, I take to this kid, so I say, ""Hey, dude, aren\'t you supposed to be in school or something?"" and he\'s like, ""Can I borrow a dollar?""I go, ""What do you need with a dollar, little man?""And he\'s, ""I\'m going to buy a candy bar for breakfast.""Now that gets my attention. A candy bar for breakfast? My heart goes out to this kid. I offer to buy him a breakfast burrito, and he\'s okay with that as long as he gets his candy bar too. When we come back out, I look around to size up what kind of traffic the kid\'s going to have to negotiate in his travels. We live just south of Oklahoma City--technically it\'s a whole different city, but with the urban sprawl you can\'t tell where one leaves off and the other begins--so we have a lot of traffic zipping around here.""Look,"" I tell him as he drips egg down the front of himself. ""This is a pretty busy intersection. How about I give you a ride to wherever you\'re going so some big rig doesn\'t barrel down and flatten you like a squirrel.""He looks me over, sizing me up just like a squirrel might actually do right before deciding to scamper off into his lair. But I\'m a trustworthy-looking guy. I have no style either--just a pair of reasonably old jeans, beat-up sneakers, and a green long-sleeve T-shirt that says Ole! on the front. My brown hair\'s too short to need much combing, and I have a little gap between my two front teeth, which gives me a friendly, good-hearted look, or so I\'m told. The point is I\'m a long way from scary.So the kid takes a chance and hops into the passenger side of my Mitsubishi Lancer. I\'ve had it for about a year--it\'s silver with a black interior, not new or anything but pretty awesome in a basic kind of way.""My name\'s Sutter Keely,"" I say. ""What\'s yours?""""Walter,"" he says around a mouthful of burrito.Walter. That\'s good. I\'ve never known a little kid named Walter. It seems like an old man\'s name, but I guess you have to start somewhere.""Now, Walter,"" I say, ""the first thing I want you to know is you shouldn\'t really take rides from strangers.""""I know,"" he says. ""Mrs. Peckinpaugh taught us all about that at Stranger Danger.""""That\'s good,"" I say. ""You should keep that in mind in the future.""And he goes, ""Yeah, but how do you know who\'s a stranger?""That cracks me up. How do you know who\'s a stranger? That\'s a kid for you. He can\'t comprehend that people might be dangerous just because you haven\'t met them yet. He\'s probably got all sorts of sinister ideas about what a stranger is--a black, slouchy hat and raincoat, a scar on the cheek, long fingernails, shark teeth. But think about it--when you\'re six years old, you haven\'t met all that many people. It would be pretty mind-_boggling to go around suspicious of ninety-nine percent of the populace.I start to explain the stranger thing to him, but his attention span isn\'t all that long and he gets sidetracked watching me pour whisky into my big 7UP.""What\'s that?"" he asks.I tell him it\'s Seagram\'s V.O., so then he wants to know why I\'m pouring it in my drink.I look at him and he has this authentic interest in his big, round eyes. He really wants to know.

The narrative begins with a very intriguing premise, a woman gravely wounded and barely conscious of her situation, left in the gutter: ""Her body lay half submerged in a puddle of murky liquid.

The author\'s ability to capture images, emotions, and to create scenes that are focused caught my attention right from the start of the story. A.L.

I also admired Detective Dennis, who may seem rough but cares more than you think, and his dedication and single-minded focus in solving his cases. This story introduces an array of plot twists which I would eagerly follow on to the next book. A.L. Bryant's skill in storytelling makes smooth transitions to the different points of view of different characters.

OJ's Knife (A Mickey Judge Mystery);"['Review', '“No one alive knows the OJ case or news gathering in LA better than John Gibson. In OJ’s Knife, he brings together all his formidable knowledge and storytelling talents. This book is a raw, bare knuckled, gritty, nail biting page turner that will keep you breathless and awake long into the night. I loved it so much I read it twice.” --Judge Andrew P. Napolitano, Senior Judicial Analyst, Fox News“In OJ’S Knife, John Gibson deftly weaves fact and fiction in this cunningly written novel. Where is the missing murder weapon mentioned in the OJ Simpson trial? Gibson’s protagonist, Mickey Judge, local NBC reporter with eyes on prime time, thinks he knows.

As Good as Gone: A Novel;"['Review', '“[A] remarkable novel. It is like watching the sunrises over the prairies of Montana about which Watson writes so eloquently.

All rights reserved.', 'A tall, lean, white-haired man stands in the open doorway of a twenty-foot house trailer, his hands jammed in the pockets of his faded Levis. Calvin Sidey, Bill’s father. A hawk with prey in sight could not watch more intently. Bill parks next to the familiar old Ford truck, yet his father makes no move to come forward. Bill climbs out of the car, and when he slams the door behind him, it sets up an echo that bounces from one canyon wall to the other. He lives here, Bill thinks, so he can see the enemy approach. It’s the same thought he’s had on the other occasions when he’s driven out to his father’s home, but this time Bill wonders if even he has that status in his father’s eyes. His father calls out warily, “I didn’t know you were coming.” To that Bill has no response. His father doesn’t have a telephone. He picks up his mail no more than once or twice a week. How could anyone, son or stranger, notify Calvin Sidey of an impending visit? His father tries again. “What brings you out this way?” And that’s Calvin Sidey in a sentence: Let’s get to it. Well, that suits Bill, too. When he looks toward his father, Bill has to shield his eyes against the sun glinting off the trailer’s aluminum siding. “I’ve got a favor to ask.” His father steps back inside the trailer, but since he doesn’t shut and lock the door behind him, Bill understands that he’s supposed to follow. The trailer’s interior, even with windows open on every side, must be fifteen degrees hotter than the July afternoon that’s already topped ninety degrees. “Can I get you a cup of coffee?” his father asks. “Coffee? Jesus. No. A glass of water? Please.” The trailer is exactly as Bill remembers it. It’s likely that nothing more than the calendar page has changed since Bill was last here, though he can’t recall when that might have been. His father has his life stripped down to the essentials, and for everything that’s left, he has a hook, shelf, bin, drawer, peg, or rack. Bill guesses that in the cupboard there are no more than one or, at most, two plates, bowls, glasses, and cups. In the same cupboard there will be a can of coffee, a box of oatmeal, a few cans of soup and beans, lard, crackers, flour, sugar, salt, and pepper. Above the two-burner stove hang a saucepan and a frying pan. On a shelf above the neatly made bed is a short row of books, and though Bill can’t see the titles, he doesn’t have to. These are his father’s copies of Virgil, Horace, Juvenal, Ovid, Cicero, Catullus, and Pliny. The homemade gun rack above the door holds his Winchester lever-action .30-30, a twelve-gauge Remington pump shotgun, and a fishing pole. And there’s that calendar, hanging right next to the door. It’s this year’s, and the page is turned to the correct month, but Bill wonders if his father knows the date. Even if he does, the day surely doesn’t mean “holiday” to him the way it does for most Americans, though it’s hard to imagine a man who values independence more than Calvin Sidey. Bill stands by the small kitchen table, but since his father has not invited him to sit down, Bill doesn’t pull out one of the two chairs. And why two, Bill wonders, since his father lives alone and never has guests? From a pitcher on the counter Calvin Sidey pours water into a glass and then sets the glass on the table next to an open book. Bill can’t decipher any of the words on the page because the book is in Latin, a subject Bill never studied in school but that his father has never stopped studying and translating. Also on the table is an ashtray containing a few butts of hand-rolled cigarettes. Bill brings the glass to his lips and drinks. The water isn’t very cold and it has a brassy odor. “Why don’t you move this trailer, Dad? That stand of cottonwoods can’t be more than fifty yards away, and if you were parked over there, you’d have some shade.” His father crosses his arms. “You said you had a favor to ask.” Bill is sweating in these close quarters, and he loosens his tie and collar. “Marjorie needs an operation.” “Uh-huh.” “She has to have a hysterectomy. It’s an operation to—” “I know what a hysterectomy is. What I don’t know is why you felt you had to come out here and tell me about it in person. How serious is this?” “She has . . . not tumors, exactly. But growths, painful growths.” “All right,” his father says. “I’m sorry to hear this. But you drove all the way out here . . . What’s the favor you need?” “Do you mind if I sit down?” Bill asks, and then pulls out a chair before his father can answer. There’s an odor in the trailer that Bill can’t quite place, a smell reminiscent of gasoline or fresh paint. He looks around to see if his father has recently painted or varnished something. Then it comes to him. Kerosene. Lacking electricity, his father relies on candles or kerosene lamps. It’s 1963, but in many ways his father is living in the nineteenth century. Of course it’s stifling inside the trailer, Bill thinks. His father doesn’t even have a fan to stir the heat or a refrigerator to keep food cold. And not far from the trailer is an outhouse. “There’s a doctor in Missoula who’ll perform the operation,” Bill says. “Carole—you remember Marjorie’s sister?—had the same condition as Marjorie. Same symptoms. Same tests. Apparently it’s something that runs in the family. And Carole had the surgery. Before then, she’d tried everything, and she says if it wasn’t for the operation, she’d still be suffering.” “Most women would just bite down hard and wait for the misery to pass. Which it will.” “', 'Most', 'women?” “In my experience.” “Something of an expert, are you, Dad?” His father ignores this question. “Marjorie has to go to Missoula? I know Gladstone’s got doctors who can perform a hysterectomy.” Bill has to smile. His father is still loyal to Gladstone, though he turned his back on the town almost thirty years ago. “How about Mitch McCoy?” his father says. “Last I heard he was still practicing.” “The last you heard? When was that? Dr. McCoy is in a nursing home in Miles City.” “Mitchell McCoy? Are you sure?” The heat, the long drive, his father’s questions . . . Bill Sidey suddenly feels tired. He leans on his hand and rubs his eyes. “Yeah, Dad. I’m sure. Look, I can’t pretend to explain it very well. Apparently the Missoula doctor has a special procedure. He doesn’t take out the entire womb or something. The point is, Marjorie wants the operation. She', 'needs', 'the operation.” “And I reckon you’re all set for her to have what she needs.” “We’re leaving in a few days.” “Uh-huh.” Bill inhales deeply and then exhales, but the heat seems to prevent his breath from traveling far. “That’s what I wanted to ask you about, Dad. Would you be willing to stay with the kids while Marjorie and I are in Missoula?” His father involuntarily takes a step back. “Have you spoken to your sister about this?” “Jeanette and I have sort of lost touch. I assume she’s still in New Hampshire. We send the Christmas and birthday cards there and they don’t come back undeliverable. Of course, we don’t get any acknowledgment from her either. How about you?” Bill asks, though he’s certain of the answer. “Do you hear from her?” His father gives a quick shake of his head. “What I’m asking you for,” says Bill, “wouldn’t be more than a week. At most.” “You’re traveling in a few days, you say?”', 'He’s trying to find a way to say no,', 'Bill thinks.', 'He’s out of practice, and he can’t find a reason quick enough. Why doesn’t he come right out and say it—they’re not my kids or my responsibility. He could say it when the children were his own, so what’s stopping him now?', 'Suddenly, Bill, who all his life has felt diminished in this man’s presence, feels an odd surge of power. “Ann and Will,” says Bill. “In case you’re trying to recall their names. Ann’s seventeen and Will’s eleven.” “I know my grandchildren’s names.” “Ann’s working at J. C. Penney this summer,” Bill continues. “That’s why I’m asking you for this favor. Ordinarily Ann could take care of her brother. And take care of the house. But with the hours she’s working, Will would be alone too much of the day.” From out of his shirt pocket, his father takes a packet of cigarette papers, and when he looks around for his tin of Sir Walter Raleigh, Bill hurries to offer his father one of his own Camels. The men light their cigarettes, and while this action has given his father an extra minute to think, it’s less time than he would have had rolling his own. “Have you been working, Dad?”', 'There,', 'Bill thinks. He has opened a door through which his father can escape. He can simply excuse himself by saying he has the obligations of a job. “Not since last fall,” his father says. “I helped George Tell move his herd down from summer pasture. I’m sure he moved them back up last month, but I didn’t hear from him. Before that? I don’t recall.” “We', 'could', 'hire a babysitter,” Bill says. “A college girl home for the summer perhaps. Though that might embarrass Ann, someone there so close to her age. Or maybe we could find a farm girl. But you know the house, Dad. And the business. And you’re—” Bill isn’t sure why he suddenly stops short of uttering the word, especially since it’s the word that he came here to say to his father. “I’m what?” “Family,” says Bill, relieved that the word didn’t snag on the way out. His father draws deep on the Camel, lets the smoke drift from his nostrils, and then examines the cigarette as if he’s never smoked a tailor-made before. “When did you say you’re leaving?” he says. “Sunday. Right after church. And Dad? I’m not asking you to do anything with the kids. Just to be there. Just in case.” His father walks to the trailer door, opens it, and flicks his cigarette outside. “I’ll be there Saturday,” he says. His father remains in the doorway, his hand on the handle of the screen door. Just as Bill understood earlier that he was supposed to follow his father inside the trailer, now he understands that he’s expected to leave. “I’ll look for you then,” Bill says. He steps out into the shadowless sunlight, and though the air’s not moving outside the trailer any more than it was inside—it’s the rare calm day in this part of Montana—Bill feels as though his first breath outdoors goes right to the bottom of his lungs. “And Bill,” his father calls after him. “Don’t put anyone out of their room.

She grew up in rural Powhatan as one of ten children, and at the tender age of two was reading her first poem, Clement Moore's 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, which she had memorized in its entirety. Her fascination with written and spoken language was enhanced by siblings, who studied and spoke Latin and French, and by beloved elders, who shared lively stories and family histories in their uniquely sumptuous, southern style. Her professional pursuits have included broadcast journalism, educational consulting, literacy instruction, and a wide assortment of writing projects. She enjoys family life with her friend Brad, who is also her husband, and their four outstanding sons. High on her favorites list are movie marathons, barefoot running, home-cooked meals, happy travel adventures, and quantum physics. She enjoys books, books, books; music; spending time with interesting, caring, ridiculously optimistic people...and whenever possible, helping others fully discover and embrace their highest potential.

Early milk-carts drew aside to give the coach passage, white-eyed sweeps gazed enviously after it, mob-caps at windows dreamt of holidays and sighed to be on it and away. Soon it burst merrily from the crowded houses and met the morning freshness and the open country and the rolling fields. The mists were rising from the valley behind, as the horses breasted the ascent above the old battle-field, swept down the farther slope, and at eight miles an hour climbed up Armour Hill between meadows sparkling with dew and coverts flickering with conies. Down the hill at a canter, which presently carried it rejoicing into Wem. There the first relay was waiting, and away again they went, bowling over the barren gorse-clad heath that brought them presently through narrow twisting streets to the White Lion at Whitchurch. Again, 'Horses on!' and merrily they travelled down the gentle slope to the Cheshire plain, where miles of green country spread themselves in the sunshine, a land of fatness and plenty, of cheese and milk and slow-running brooks. The clock on Nantwich church was showing a half after eight, as with a long flourish on the bugle they passed below it, and halted for breakfast at the Crown, in the stubborn old Roundhead town.Half an hour to refresh, topping up with a glass of famous Nantwich ale, and away again. But now the sun was high, the world abroad, the roads were alive with traffic. Onwards from Nantwich, where they began to run alongside the Ellesmere Canal, with its painted barges and gay market boats, the road took on a new importance, and many a smiling wayside house, Lion or Swan, cheered the travellers on their way. Spanking four-in-hands, handled by lusty coachmen, the autocrats of the road, chaises-and-four with postboys in green or yellow, white-coated farmers and parsons on hackneys, commercials in gigs, and publicans in tax-carts, pedlars, packmen, the one-legged sailor, and Punch and Judy-all these met or passed them; and huge wains laden with Manchester goods and driven by teamsters in smocks with long whips on their shoulders.

York Ferry;"['From Publishers Weekly', ""Vernon Pinny's unexpected departure in 1960 is his family's defining moment. It informs the lives of his five children and his wife for years afterward. His wife, Kay, feels ambivalent, since he leaves her to search for the grave of a Belgian Jewish woman he had met during WW II, before his marriage, but he never gets to Europe. Vernon's children are unknowingly destined to relive many of his mistakes. The setting and characters fully complement each other. The Pinny family lives in a small town in the Adirondacks that over two decades changes from a self-sufficient place that makes money off of its summer residents to an empty exurb overwhelmed by a larger city. This change culminates in the closing of the local grocery store, where two Pinnys are employed. The Pinny clan includes an alcoholic, a married son who has an affair with an Israeli exchange student, and the only daughter, who joins the Coast Guard in order to break out and finds herself in an equally insular atmosphere. Their adventures during the 1960s and 1970s are absorbing; Dawid conveys the gossip, misfortune and comforts of small-town life with grace in this, her first novel."", 'Copyright 1992 Cahners Business Information, Inc.', 'Review', 'Winner: 2016 Rubery Award for Fiction', 'This is an ambitious novel, told with irresistibly smooth prose, that traces a family over twenty years, seeing inside the head of each one with extraordinary insight.\xa0 The father leaves while the children are young, and his presence hovers over them as they mature, his absence inevitably influencing the development of their personalities.\xa0 It \xa0almost reads like a succession of short stories about the world as it used to be and as it is now.\xa0 \xa0The book is unexpectedly gripping, authentic, immediate - it is reminiscent of Anne Tyler - a world where the action is secondary to the truth of beautifully observed lives.\xa0 It has to be read slowly to appreciate its true worth.\u2028Judges Clare Morrall, William Gallagher, Jeff Phelps, United KingdomNew York Times Book Review, Feb. 14, 1993With an epigraph from John Donne (""Love\'s mysteries in souls do grow""), Annie Dawid\'s first novel, set in a small town on Lake Champlain, addresses powerful subjects: the paradoxical presence of an absent father and the inscrutability of the human heart. ""York Ferry"" charts two decades following the day in June 1960 when Vernon Pinny, a World War II veteran and local garage mechanic, abandons his wife, Kay, and their five children. In the first of his letters to her, Vernon expresses confusion about his departure, alluding to the troubling memory of his first love, killed in Belgium during the war. On the grounds that he has always been a ""good husband,"" Vernon asks Kay to wait for him. In the years that follow, his family, predictably enough, suffers as a result. ""York Ferry"" is written with an eye for landscape and the ability to render key dramatic moments vividly. Although the dialogue is occasionally stilted, and though Vernon\'s absence is problematic for the reader as well as his family (his letters explains some of his motives, but never make him come alive), Ms. Dawid\'s underlying message is true and appealing: rational explanations for people\'s actions, especially concerning love, can often elude us. -- Gardner McFallLos Angeles Times, January 1993Annie Dawid\'s first novel chronicles two decades of an ongoing family crisis in a small Upstate New York town. Kay Pinny has independence thrust upon her when her husband leaves to search for the remnants of a wartime romance. She struggles to raise her children under the shadow of a father who is gone but might reappear at any moment. Submerging herself in her family, Kay grows strong, but she becomes -- perhaps inevitably -- a collage of others\' expectations: mother, gardener, wage-earner, etc. Dawid\'s understated evocation of life in a moribund hamlet suggests that the image of love can seem as important as the reality.Small Press Review, Summer 1993In this first novel, Annie Dawid establishes that she is already an accomplished writer. Set in York Ferry, New York, a poor summer town on Lake Champlain, the novel follows Kay Pinny and her five children in the twenty years between her husband Vernon\'s desertion of the family and his death. The narrative (sprinkled with epistolary sections) cleanly shifts from abandoned Kay to each child as they grow into five very different and sometimes tragic adults. As the reunited family returns to their separate lives after Vernon\'s funeral at the end, they\'re each released a second time, this time permanently, from Vernon\'s long shadow.Though outstanding first novels are always cause for celebration, Annie Dawid is not just another promising rookie. Pulling off believable (and empathetic) portraits of several characters is no small task for any writer. Like a master cabinet maker whose mitred joints appear like a single block of wood, Dawid crafts these characters from just 180 seamless pages. Readers of', 'York Ferry', 'are in the hands of a prodigy. -- W.E.

The product of a journalism class, \xa0To My Professor: Students Voices for Great College Teaching\xa0(Read the Spirit Books) distills thousands of student comments and bits of advice into a cleverly organized, timely read. It should appeal to anyone interested in improving instruction or simply knowing what students think, beyond the seeming randomness of teacher rating websites or the targeted feedback in student evaluations of teaching.""What makes this book unique is the fact that it is written by students,"" said Meaghan Markey, an advertising major at Michigan State who wrote or helped write sections on student parents, Hmong students and online classes. ""What we wrote isn\'t just theory, it\'s things we as students have actually experienced. Our goal with To My Professor is to give students a voice and for professors to hear us.""Markey and her journalism classmates began writing the book in January. The original idea -- as in previous iterations of the course -- was to write a cultural competency guide for the university classroom. But it soon evolved into something bigger: a book on contemporary teaching informed and written largely by students. Classmates started with a simple prompt\xa0-- ""To my professor..."" -- which yielded thousands of comments through social media and other websites, along with\xa0in-person interviews and focus groups. About half the comments came from students at Michigan State, and half came from those\xa0elsewhere. The authors divided that feedback into recurrent themes, eventually coming up with chapters on topics from course structures and syllabi, student engagement and technology to inclusion of students of all races, cultures and abilities.Each chapter and subsection starts with original student comments, scrubbed for anonymity. The chapter on racial inclusion, for example, starts with quotes including ""Just because I\'m black I cannot speak for all my \'people\'"" and ""When your professor is so biased toward Latinas and undermines the hardships that Asians have to go through in this society.""""Racial tensions can arise abruptly in the classroom,"" the book reads, summarizing student comments and relevant research. ""Sometimes, the tension is due to something an instructor says: the wrong word, an awkward attempt at humor or a stereotype laid bare. And sometimes, students argue about racial issues. Whatever the case, professors are responsible for handling these conflicts. They cannot just be ignored.""...In a separate section on grades and feedback, Angela Duckworth, Christopher H. Browne Distinguished Professor of Psychology at Pennsylvania and author of Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance, recommends that professors move the focus from grades to feedback, to alleviate anxiety and even complaints. Duckworth says that college students are relatively starved for feedback, because they received it daily or weekly in a high school, and says professors should tell students how they\'re doing much more frequently. ...', 'From the Author', 'As educators, we know learning and change can be uncomfortable. Some ""To My Professor"" statements in this book should make us feel uneasy. Some may seem harsh, one-sided or unfair. Faculty who saw some of the students\' statements as the book was being written reacted: ""No, that did not happen!"" ""They got upset about that?"" ""They don\'t understand."" ""That\'s the exception."" Denial is a defense response hard-wired into all of us since well before Confucius and Plato. We don\'t like to feel attacked.\xa0When you opened this book, you showed that you want to know what students think, no matter what. And you will find some hero stories among the horror stories.As college instructors, we have many channels for telling students what to do and how to do it. We lecture, we assign, we email, we test, we check, we grade and we meet with them one-on-one. We write the syllabi. We make the rules. When we want to send students a message, we professors communicate through fire hoses. In contrast, students have only squirt guns to fire back at us. This project gives students another channel. But we did not just want you to get a little wet. So, we added strategies from other professors. In the end, most college students and instructors all want great teaching, and we all respect the power of dialogue. So here it is.When we go into our classrooms and lecture halls, we do so with clear objectives and noble intentions. We have our students\' best interests at heart. We want to teach our best and send our students off onto successful journeys. But there are bumps in teaching road: limited time, growing class sizes, student readiness and every kind of technology. There are a thousand demands and distractions, and students see their college experience through millions of different lenses.\xa0Sometimes, it seems that the longer we teach, the more we put into our teaching and the better we get at it, the harder teaching becomes.Campuses, temples of free thought and speech, are increasingly places where some teachers and students feel they must walk on eggshells. In 2016, the Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles released its 50th annual survey of first-year college students. The study included 141,189 full-time students attending about 200 four-year universities around the country. About 71 percent of the students said they agreed ""colleges should prohibit racist/sexist speech on campus,"" the highest rate ever for silencing speech. Asked whether ""colleges have the right to ban extreme speakers from campus"" 43 percent of the students agreed, about twice what it was in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s when many of today\'s professors were students. Racist, sexist and extreme speech was not defined in the study, but students seem more ready than ever to shut it down. In contrast, students said in the survey, and have shown on campuses, that they are more willing than they have been in years to demonstrate about their grievances.A number of our colleagues have reacted in the press that students want to be coddled or feel they have a right to be free from being offended. Some have said that honest teaching means that students should be offended, because the stimulus provokes them to think and question and prepares them for the real world after college.Instructors are at the fulcrum of this tippy balance between free speech and respectful dialogue. Once-innocent words have new, sinister meanings. Jokes meant to lighten lessons have become leaden storm clouds. To provoke, in the best sense, has become the worst kind of incitement. Our students have a wider range of perspectives and expectations than ever. The embrace of inclusion is growing wider all the time. Yet financial pressures and technology seem to discourage individualized teaching. As hard as we try and as much as we prepare, sometimes, we just screw up. In the moment when the milk is spilled and dozens of students are watching to see how we are going to clean it up, we goof. A comment that would surely help one student is surely wrong for others. Sometimes, when we know we should de-escalate a situation we watch ourselves elevate it. In college classrooms, issues play out on a stage where they are magnified and scrutinized in full view of an audience equipped to record and broadcast the events. No, it is not easy to be a professor, instructor or teaching assistant.\xa0But we hope the articles and resources in this book will help you teach the way you and your students want. Be open to voices you seldom get to hear and that may not actually be directed at you. You won\'t get many chances to hear what you\'ll find in ""To My Professor.""', 'From the Back Cover', 'In ""To My Professor: Student Voices for Great College Teaching,"" students tell us what they really think. They say and write what they seldom tell professors directly, giving those at the front of the classroom a rare glimpse into the minds of those in the back. The book includes statements, notes and social media comments by students describing experiences wonderful and painful, uplifting and unbelievable.\xa0You will hear from students who live at the margins, transfer students, students with invisible challenges and student veterans. Some feel excluded, isolated or misunderstood. Then, you will find strategies and resources for better college instruction in more than 50 situations. They include teaching a growing variety of students, being flexible and fair, recovering from mistakes, dealing with racial tensions and using humor.\xa0Much of what teaching assistants, adjunct instructors and tenured professors know is learned and tested on the job. It comes from classrooms, faculty seminars or other teachers and mentors. Most teaching literature benefits students in the end, but this book puts the student perspective at the beginning. It is written by a Michigan State University journalism class.\xa0Learn what students and master educators say about classroom management and the challenges of communication, inclusion, grading, student health and safety, technology and support.', 'About the Author', 'Project editor Joe Grimm joined the Michigan State University School of Journalism as visiting editor in residence in 2008.

Flourishing Lives: Exploring Natural Law Liberalism;"['Review', ""'Most particularly in an age of illiberal populism, ‘liberalism' urgently needs redefinition, away from its bizarre US definition as yet another collectivism. Chartier's brilliant and wide-ranging book defends a new, and old, liberalism in detail. It is, as he says, ‘a confident reassertion of liberalism', but willing to listen to the other side, and to consider. His ‘radical' liberalism is in fact a modest and reasonable program for a flourishing world of natural-law equals.' Deirdre N. McCloskey, University of Illinois, Chicago‘This book is a rich exploration of two strands of natural law theory and how they contribute to flourishing for us all. Linking his preferred natural law view with the broad liberal tradition, Gary Chartier shows how ‘natural law liberalism' might shed new light on a wide range of issues.' John Hagel, author of The Power of Pull‘I can't name a higher intellectual priority than reframing and reviving liberalism. Chartier does just this in his humane, learned, and erudite manifesto. His liberalism seeks appealingly to foster the good life and universal ennoblement through voluntary means - in a way consistent with human rights and social harmonies. Read it. Believe it.' Jeffrey A. Tucker, American Institute for Economic Research‘This is a masterful work. Drawing on a version of Aristotelian natural law theory and Scottish Enlightenment insights into spontaneous order, Gary Chartier elaborates a natural law position that supports liberal social and political views. But Chartier takes his arguments in unexpected directions, and in so doing illuminates issues of genuine theoretical and practical significance. In each case, Chartier's analysis helps to elaborate and defend his theoretical framework. Flourishing Lives is philosophy at its best - advancing our understanding of natural law and drawing on this understanding to support timely and provocative conclusions.' James Stacey Taylor, College of New Jersey‘… a pleasure to read and a stimulating occasion for one’s own reflections … I doubt that many liberals will be persuaded to embrace natural law as a result of reading the book or that many traditional natural lawyers will be moved to endorse Chartier’s radical liberalism, but all will be better for the intellectual workout, and many of Chartier’s particular arguments deserve a hearing.’ V.

Author Diggory, professor of English at Skidmore College, was assisted by several poets as well as academic contributors. Well-known first-generation poets, such as John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch, and Frank O’Hara, are found in general reference works on American poetry including the Encyclopedia of American Poetry: The Twentieth Century (2001), The Facts On File Companion to 20th-Century American Poetry (2005), and the Greenwood Encyclopedia of American Poets and Poetry (2005). The current work provides coverage of lesser-known poets such as Edwin Denby, Kenward Elmslie, and Tony Towle as well. In addition to poets, there are entries for individual works and topics such as Eighth Street Bookstore, Living Theatre, Minimalism, Performance art, and Politics. Entries are followed by bibliographies of print and online resources. Valuable supplemental features include a selected bibliography; a subject list of entries; maps of Manhattan and Long Island showing locations important in the history of New York School poets (for example, the Nuyorican Poets Café); and a time line ranging from 1944 to 2008.

All rights reserved.', ""On the second day after her return to Elantra, the city she policed as a groundhawk, Private Kaylin Neya fell out of bed, daggers in hands, knees bent. After one confused moment, she sheathed her daggers, took a brief look around the otherwise empty royal guest chambers that served as her temporary home, and let loose a volley of Leontine curses.The small, translucent winged lizard that habitually slept above her head squawked in protest; she'd swept him out of the way without a second thought. He hovered in front of her face as she cursed; she didn't, at the moment, have anything left over for groveling apologies.Leontine wasn't the usual language heard in the halls of the Imperial Palace. Nor was it generally heard in the function rooms, and when it was, it wasn't the particular phrasing she now indulged in. On the other hand, the thunderous sounds that had driven her from sleep pretty much guaranteed that no one who'd care could possibly hear her words. Kaylin could scream until she was blue in the face, with the same results. Anyone in the palace halls could, at the moment.Dragons were having a discussion.When she'd first heard Dragons converse in their native tongue, she'd thought of earthquakes or tidal waves. Distinguishing individual voices had been less important than covering both her ears in the vague hope she'd preserve some of her hearing. A couple of weeks in the palace with Bellusdeo for a companion had changed that. She could pick out three loud—painfully loud—voices in the crash of distant thunder: Diarmat's, Bellusdeo's and…the Emperor's. While she generally enjoyed the arguments between Bellusdeo and Diarmat, she had zero desire to ever interrupt—or witness—any argument which also contained the Emperor. Even mention of the Emperor was probably career-limiting.It was dark, but the storm of sound in progress didn't seem like it would die down any time soon, and sleep was pretty much impossible—at least for Kaylin. The rest of the Dragon Court was probably in hiding, but Immortals didn't need anything as petty as sleep.The minute—the"", 'second', '—she had the time to find a new place, she was', 'so', 'out of here.The small dragon landed on her shoulders. She\'d named him Hope, but felt self-conscious actually calling him that, and she hadn\'t had time to come up with a name that suited him better. He yawned, folded himself across her shoulders like a badly formed shawl, and closed his eyes. Clearly, Dragon shouting didn\'t bother him in the slightest.Then again, he probably understood what they were saying.The palace was never dark. Individual rooms had lighting that responded to the needs of the guests who occupied them, but the halls—the grand, wide, towering halls—were always fully lit. The Imperial Palace Guard also adorned those halls, standing like statues in a stiff, grim silence that suited their pretension.They didn\'t stop Kaylin as she walked past them, heading to one of the only places that she was certain was somewhat soundproof. They knew her on sight, and if they\'d had no issues treating her as one step up from a convicted felon in the past, she was now roommate to the Empire\'s only female Dragon. The Emperor didn\'t want anyone to piss Bel-lusdeo off.Anyone, Kaylin thought glumly, but the Emperor himself. Dragons had never been famously good at sharing.When she reached the tall and forbidding doors of the Imperial Library, she had second thoughts. It wasn\'t that the Imperial Library was home in all but name to the Arkon, the oldest member of the Dragon Court. It wasn\'t that the doors were closed; they were almost always closed. It wasn\'t even his extreme dislike of being interrupted.It was the door ward that straddled them.She\'d woken to the sounds of angry Dragon, which pretty much defined Bad Day. Having to place her palm against this particular ward took Bad Day and made it worse. At the best of times, Kaylin\'s allergy to magic made door wards uncomfortable—but this ward could raise so much noise it might just interrupt the Dragons. One of whom was the Emperor.There was no other way to open them. Kaylin briefly considered knocking. With her head. Before she could—and it was late enough, or early enough, that she might have—the doors surprised her by gliding open. No one stood between them.At this hour, the library desk—the publicly accessible library desk—was unmanned. The display cases and the rows upon rows of standing files were shadowed. The robed clerks who kept the library spotless were conspicuous by their absence—but that was no surprise. No one sane visited the library at this hour.As the doors rolled closed at her back, the sound of Dragon anger diminished.The Arkon made his way toward her from the back of the large room, which surprised Kaylin; she\'d expected to find him holed up in one of the many, many rooms that comprised his personal collection—none of which the public was invited to peruse.""Thank you for opening the doors,"" she told him.""I felt it best to avoid interrupting the ongoing discussion. No one involved in it is likely to be amused by the sudden need to attend to intruders.""""I live here, at the moment.""""Indeed. I imagine the only person present who might find a disaster of your making remotely convenient is Lord Diarmat.""""Who doesn\'t deserve it.""""You give him too little credit.""""Do I?""The Arkon\'s smile was lined. It was also sharp. ""Perhaps I will beg the Emperor\'s indulgence.""In theory, this sounded good. Given the way the day had started, it couldn\'t be. ""How?""""I might ask permission to teach you the rudiments of our language."" His smile deepened as her eyes rounded and her brows rose.""I\'ll go deaf!""""Yes. Follow me, please. You interrupted me,"" he added. ""I don\'t know how you can work with that ruckus going on in the background.""""It is difficult. I do not have the concentration I once possessed in my youth.""""So, what are they arguing about exactly?""""Bellusdeo\'s status at court, at the moment; the argument has touched on many subjects."" The Arkon\'s eyes were a steady shade of orange, which wasn\'t a good sign, in a Dragon.""What about her status? She\'s a Dragon, so she\'s technically a Lord of the Court.""""That is true only in mortal terms. She is not—as Diarmat has been at pains to point out—a Lord of', 'this', 'Court. She has not offered the Emperor an oath of fealty; nor has she agreed—in a binding fashion—to abide by the laws he hands down.""""She spends most of her free time with', 'me,""', 'Kaylin replied. ""I\'m a groundhawk. She probably knows the law better than anyone who isn\'t.""""You misunderstand. Humans are not, of course, required to take such a binding oath—I believe they would not survive it. Bellusdeo has not been required to do so. Lord Diar-mat correctly points out that she therefore poses a risk to the Court."" He stopped at a smooth, flat wall. It was unadorned; Kaylin suspected it was actually a door.The Arkon barked a sharp, harsh word and proved her suspicion correct; a part of the wall simply faded from sight. What lay on the other side of it was a disaster. It made Kay-lin\'s desk at its worst look pristine and tidy. Hells, it made Marcus\'s desk look wellorganized, which Kaylin would have bet was impossible.The Arkon noted her hesitation. ""Is there a difficulty?""""Just how important is all the paper—that is paper, isn\'t it?""""Parchment. Some paper. There is also stone and a few shards of smooth glass. I trust that you will disturb nothing while you are here.""""How?""He raised a brow; his eyes didn\'t get any more orange, which was a small mercy.""There\'s stuff all over the', 'floor.', 'There\'s stuff all over the chairs. I probably can\'t put a foot down without stepping on something.""""Then do not, as you put it, put a foot down."" He gestured.The hair on Kaylin\'s arms and the back of her neck rose in instant protest.""Do not,"" he said, in a more severe tone of voice, ""make me regret my foolish and sentimental decision to take pity on you and provide you some form of refuge.""Folding her arms across her chest, she walked into the room; her feet touched nothing. Neither did the Arkon\'s.""Not to be suspicious or anything,"" she began.""You do not think me capable of either sentiment or pity?""""Not much, no. Not for me.""His smile deepened. ""As you point out, Private, Bellusdeo did spend most of her free time in your presence. You have not, however, been in the city for the past month and a half. She has therefore had no anchor. No friends, if you prefer. In the last two weeks of your absence, she has spent a greater portion of her time in the fief of Tiamaris, speaking with the refugees there. When she chooses to enter the fief, she is met by one of the', 'Norannir""', '""That would be Maggaron.""""The Emperor does not consider Maggaron to be a suitable guard in the fiefs; Lord Tiamaris, however, is. She has accepted—with poor grace—the Emperor\'s wishes in this regard.""""What happened?""""She has taken to flying in the restricted air-space above the fief of Tiamaris.""""It\'s not Imperial land.""""No. She has pointed this out—at length. You might have recognized one or two of the words she used, if you were paying attention. She has, however, come close to the borders of the fief once too often for the Emperor\'s comfort.""""The', 'Norannir', 'live on the borders.""""Indeed. She has taken pains to point this out, as well.""""He\'s going to isolate her! The', 'Norannir', 'are the only other friends she has in this city!""The Arkon\'s smile was softer, and infinitely more pained. ""They are not her friends, Kaylin. They were once her subjects. She is not merely a Dragon to them; she is akin to a living god. Bellusdeo has her vanity. She has her pride. But she, like any Dragon, understands her role in their lives. She does not go to them for their sake, but her own. They remind her of who she once was.""There is altogether too much in the Palace that reminds her of what she now is.""Kaylin\'s arms tightened. ""And what, exactly, is that?""""A displaced person. She is very much the equivalent of the', 'Norannir.', 'You think of her as a Lord of the Court, and you have some rudimentary understanding of the political power that title might give her. She lives in the Palace, and not in the mean streets of the fiefs that border', 'Ravellon.', 'She has food, should she desire it, and clothing; she has money. But the', 'Norannir', 'have more freedom than Bellusdeo now does.""""Why are you telling me this? Why not say this to the Emperor?""""Do you think I have not?"" His eyes shaded to a color that was more copper than orange. Kaylin couldn\'t remember what it meant, she\'d seen it so rarely. In fact, she\'d seen it only once: in Bellusdeo\'s eyes. ""I have told the Emperor that Bellusdeo cannot live in a cage. He does not intend to cage her—but regardless, he does. She is too valuable to risk. We have already seen how close to disaster we came.""""Arkon—"" Kaylin froze, and only in part because the muted draconic voices had risen in volume. ""Please tell me this argument has nothing to do with my moving out.""""You are not, that I recall, fond of unnecessary dishonesty."" He took a seat. It was the only seat in the room that seemed to have enough exposed surface to sit on. ""If Bellusdeo can be said to have one friend in the Empire, it is you. She found your absence far more difficult than either she—or you—had imagined she would.""""She said this?""""Of course not."" He winced; it took Kaylin a couple of seconds to realize it wasn\'t because of anything she\'d said. Unlike her, he could understand every word that was being said. Or shouted. ""You have made it clear to Bellusdeo that life in the Imperial Palace does not suit you.""""Not in those exact words, no.""""Refrain from repeating the exact phrasing.""Because Kaylin loved her job on most days, she did.""You intend to find another domicile?""""Yes. As soon as I can."" When he lifted a brow, she thought of the job she loved—none of which included pandering to annoyed Dragons. On the other hand, survival often did. ""Look, there are people who would kill to live in the Palace. I\'m certain of it. But they\'re the people the Hawklord goes out of his way to prevent me from meeting. Everything in my Palace rooms—everything—costs more than the clothing on my back. I feel like I should bathe', 'before', 'I step foot through the door.""I can\'t leave or enter without an inquisition. I have to deal with Imperial Guards on a daily basis for no other reason than that I live here.""""They are there for the protection and security of our guests.""""Fine. But I don\'t want to', 'be', 'a guest in my own home. I want to be able to', 'live there.', 'Bellusdeo is a Dragon. When she dons Court dresses, they fit her', 'and', 'look good. She understands the powerful. She', 'has', 'power. I\'m a groundhawk. I can barely make ends meet on my cruddy pay. I\'m not in her class—and I know it.""I came from the fiefs. I work on the streets. I don\'t belong here, and I can\'t be happy where I don\'t belong.""""You are a Lord of the High Court.""""The Barrani High Court, and you know damn well I don\'t have to live in the High Halls.""""You have visited them before.""""I visited them with', 'Teela.""', '""And the difference?""She grimaced. There was a difference. She wasn\'t certain what it was. ""Teela\'s a Hawk.""""And Bellusdeo is not.""""Bellusdeo would never swear the oath the Halls of Law require.""""No. Lord Teela did?""""Lord Teela doesn\'t give a damn about nonbinding oaths. They\'re just words, as far as the Barrani are concerned. There is no way Marcus would ever allow Bellusdeo to join the Hawks.""""Ah, yes. Your Sergeant\'s famous mistrust of my kind."" His eyes, however, shaded toward gold. He clearly found Marcus amusing. ""Your Teela understands the High Court, and she avoids it where possible. But if you enter that world, she enters it beside you—and she warns others, by presence alone, that there are consequences to any actions they might take against you. Bellusdeo cannot do that, here. And she is aware that she lacks that ability; the Palace is not her home. It is not an environment with which she is familiar, or over which she has ultimate control.""Still, she tries. She targets Diarmat with the full brunt of her outraged disdain. Her outrage,"" he added, ""is genuine. She feels your marks are not accorded the respect they are due. She does not fully consider the advantage in being underestimated—and I will say, now, that there is a distinct advantage to you, in my opinion.

DRAGONS KINGS DRAGONLING 6;"['From School Library Journal', 'Grade 3-4?In this sixth book in the series, young Darek of Zoriac, his friends, and their dragons must guide an army against the cruel Kradens of the Black Mountains, who keep Zorians as slaves. The commander of the army is Zarnak, a Zorian tyrant who wants to rule his country and conquer the Kradens. Luckily, Darek\'s previous adventures in the Black Mountains have earned him knowledge and friendships that aid him and his dragon in bringing peace and taking away Zarnak\'s power. This title begins slowly, with much explanation of the characters\' previous exploits, and continues to move sluggishly until the very end, when the resolution comes about with dizzying speed. Furthermore, there isn\'t much here about the bond between Darek and his dragon, which is a staple of dragon lore, and the characters remain flat and uninteresting. Suggest Bruce Coville\'s Sarah and the Dragon (HarperCollins, 1984; o.p.) or Ruth Stiles Gannett\'s oldie-but-goodie, My Father\'s Dragon (Random, 1986) to young dragon lovers.

The CRYSTAL DROP;"['From School Library Journal', ""Grade 5-10-- By the year 2011, global warming and an enlarged hole in the ozone have turned southern Alberta, once a fertile plain, into a burning desert. Adolescent Megan has grown up watching her neighbors leave and her family's water supply dwindle. Abandoned by her father, she harbors few illusions about human or natural generosity. After her mother dies in childbirth, she and her 10-year-old brother, Ian, leave their home and walk west, toward Lundbreck Falls in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies. There, in the last years of the 20th century, her Uncle Greg helped found a community called Gaia. Drawn by her vision of tumbling water, Megan coaxes and bullies Ian across the ravaged landscape. Every human they meet is a competitor for the scarce resources, from the bitter descendants of the Blackfoot people to survivalists who guard their water with bullets. Readers share Megan's growing horror as she begins to comprehend the enormity of the ecological disaster that is her legacy, and admire her grit as she struggles on. While the trumpet of doom sounds a bit too shrill, and the story ends abruptly, the flaws of this compelling survival story are outweighed by colorful writing, believable characters, and a palpable landscape. --Margaret A.

Amid the laughter, splashing, and chatter, each group of children probably includes one or two who struggle with some form of anxiety. Perhaps in the youngest class a three-year-old boy sits in his mother’s lap, thumb in his mouth, face buried in her shirt, while a teacher patiently tries to coax him into the water. In another class, a six-year-old girl steps happily into the pool, splashes her feet, then bursts into angry tears when a few drops of water land on her face. In the hallway a nine-year-old boy engages in a fierce debate with his mother:“You know you’ll have a good time as soon as your class starts. You enjoyed swimming last week.”“I just want to go home, I hate swimming!”A twelve-year-old realizes as she begins her dive that one of her competitors is the top-ranked diver in their age group. She feels butterflies in her stomach and hesitates, spoiling her well-practiced dive.The youngest child at the pool is anxious about separation from his mother, while the six-year-old is scared by the physical sensation of water in her face. The boy in the hall is eager to swim when he imagines it at home, but gets scared and tries to avoid it once he is at the door. Ashamed of his fear, or perhaps unaware of it, he covers it up with anger. The oldest child has performance anxiety marked by worried “what if” thoughts: What if I mess up? Each of these children is anxious, yet each is anxious in a different way.So what is anxiety? That’s a tough question, because we use so many different words with overlapping meanings to describe it. Anxiety is sometimes regarded as milder or vaguer than fear, but an anxiety attack is the same as a panic attack, and that can be quite severe. Anxiety can be an emotion, a physical state, or troubling thoughts and beliefs. Stress usually refers to prolonged anxiety, while worries and obsessions are anxious thought patterns. Nervous habits and compulsions are anxious behaviors. Dread and terror suggest extreme anxiety, but these words are also hard to precisely define. Most children get anxious once in a while; others are anxious most of the time. Some are anxious and don’t even know it. It’s confusing! We’ll have to settle for a rough guide rather than a precise definition.You may have noticed that my imprecise definition of anxiety is not based on a list of anxiety disorders. That’s because I don’t think diagnosis is especially useful in childhood anxiety. I’d rather understand the impact of anxiety on children’s thoughts, bodies, emotions, relationships, and behaviors. The opposites of worry, anxiety, and fear are also hard to define. The opposite of danger is safety, and the opposite of anxiety is security—or is it confidence? Or relaxation? What’s the opposite of fear? Fearlessness, courage, or calmness? The opposite of worry is trust that all is well. Again, it’s confusing.The Positive Side of AnxietyWhatever words we use, we usually focus on the painful side of anxiety, the side that makes children miserable and leaves parents helpless. But anxiety has a positive side as well. A little bit is necessary for our mental health, our success in life, and even our survival. A healthy dose of anxiety drives us to avoid danger, take effective action, and perform at our peak. Complete relaxation isn’t very useful for activities that require alertness and muscle control, like taking a test or diving into a pool. Anxiety only becomes unhealthy when there is excessive distress or excessive avoidance, like the anxious children at the pool.Too much anxiety and you’re “worried sick.” Too little and you get nothing done, or you fail to take necessary precautions. We need fear when we are in danger, because fear galvanizes us to call for help, run, hide, or fight for our lives. Of course, that only helps us when our lives are really in danger. Fear when a tiger is actually chasing you is crucial for survival. Fear of a tiger in a zoo is excessive. Fear of a story about a tiger is really excessive.Healthy anxiety also keeps us from acting immorally. Our conscience uses anxiety as a reminder that we will get in trouble or feel guilty if we do something morally wrong. Again, this anxiety can get out of hand, creating guilt or shame when we haven’t done anything wrong.We don’t have time to think things through carefully when we are in real danger. We need a fast system, and anxiety is faster than the speed of thought. If that sounds impossible, consider that we often feel uneasy before we know why. We all have a little bit of “Spider-Sense,” the superpower of the comic book hero Spider-Man, which warns us when something feels wrong before we have time to process all the information carefully. Spider-Man wouldn’t call it anxiety, but that’s basically what it is: a signal to look around carefully for danger and prepare for action. Healthy anxiety shows up really fast, does its job, and then steps aside to let slower and more logical thought take over. With excess anxiety, that reasonable side has trouble stepping in.Too much anxiety doesn’t kill us; it just makes us miserable. Well, it doesn’t kill us right away. Stress has terrible effects on health, but in a dangerous situation it’s safer to have too much anxiety than too little. That may be why so many children have excessive anxiety. As parents it’s hard to get the balance just right. We want our children to worry enough about a test that they study for it, but not so much that they refuse to go to school. We want them to check their homework for errors, but not to be such perfectionists that their papers are in tatters from repeated erasing. We want them to wash their hands, but not for five minutes at a time. We want them to know what to do in case of fire, but we don’t want them preoccupied with the possibility of a fire every time they enter a building.Many anxious children worry that they aren’t smart, because they know they act irrationally at times. I always remind them that it wouldn’t be very smart to have no anxiety. Intelligence doesn’t protect a person from troubling emotions. In fact, many anxious children are highly intelligent—it takes a lot of brainpower to think of the things they worry about! Anxious children also need to know that they have emotional strengths. It’s common in childhood for vulnerabilities in one area to be balanced by strengths in another.I met recently with the parents of Constantine, a boy with significant anxiety. They described him as imaginative, creative, joyful, and funny, with a long attention span—when not in his anxious state. This list is quite typical of children with high anxiety. Their parents and teachers often say they are mature for their age, verbally precocious, sensitive, and able to relate well to adults. We often encourage anxious children to take more risks in life, but on the bright side, we don’t have to worry that they will be extreme risk-takers and thrill-seekers.The Suffering Caused by AnxietyWhen anxiety reaches too high a level, the suffering can be intense. Rob, a nine-year-old boy, sent me an email between therapy sessions: “Lately I’ve been getting very worried about dying and that hurricanes will reach here. I’m having a really hard time dealing with it and I wanted to tell you before Thursday. I’m getting really, really worried. I feel really tense inside. I’m having trouble falling asleep and just enjoying life. I wish that there is a way to solve this. I’m urgent to find a solution quickly. Can you help me find any solution?”Anxiety causes a range of suffering from mild to moderate to severe, and from occasional to frequent to nearly constant. The distress of childhood anxiety can take many forms:• Physical sensations, such as pounding heart, shallow breathing, tense muscles, butterflies or churning in the stomach, trembling and sweating, hot or cold skin.• Frequent urination, gastrointestinal distress, or incontinence.• Anxious thoughts, pessimistic beliefs, and worries. What if something bad happens? If only I had done something differently. I know my teacher hates me.• Rumination, in which the same thoughts or images are repeated over and over with no resolution.• Cognitive inflexibility, which involves a fear of risks, avoidance of anything new, or an intense reaction to changed routines.• Nervous habits such as nail biting, hair pulling, fidgeting, or chewing on clothes.• An emotional state of alarm, apprehension, panic, dread, or always feeling on guard.• Fears of specific things—real or imaginary—such as dogs, bugs, or monsters under the bed.• A tendency to perceive the world as generally threatening or dangerous.• Avoidance of anything that arouses fear or anxiety, and extreme emotional upset when avoidance is impossible.• Behavior patterns such as shyness, clinginess, indecisiveness, perfectionism, compulsions, or an attempt to completely control one’s environment.• Escalating demands for reassurance, with increased feelings of desperation. When reassurance is given, however, it is often rejected.You can see that anxiety can affect children’s bodies, thoughts, emotions, behaviors, and relationships. This means that every child’s anxiety will look different and feel different.Consider two children, Mara and Cal, in a movie theater. Mara sits with her parents. Suddenly a picture of a shark fills the screen, along with scary music. Mara feels strong physical sensations in her body; that is anxiety. She thinks, I have to get out of here and What if that shark comes after me? Those thoughts are anxiety. She runs for the exit; that is anxiety. She has trouble falling asleep that night and when she does she wakes up with nightmares—more anxiety. The next time her family goes to a movie she doesn’t want to go, even though she understands there will be no sharks in it. That avoidance is also anxiety, and it may spread to other activities that Mara used to enjoy.', 'Read more']";17.0;Lawrence J.

A Dog's Purpose: A Novel for Humans (A Dog's Purpose, 1);"['From Publishers Weekly', ""A tail-wagging three hanky boo-hooer, this delightful fiction debut by newspaper columnist Cameron (8 Simple Rules for Marrying My Daughter) proposes that a dog's purpose might entail being reborn several times. Told in a touching, doggy first-person, this unabashedly sentimental tale introduces Toby, who's rescued by a woman without a license for her rescue operation, so, sadly, Toby ends up euthanized. He's reborn in a puppy mill and after almost dying while left in a hot car, he's saved again by a woman, and he becomes Bailey, a beloved golden retriever, who finds happiness and many adventures. His next intense incarnation is as Ellie, a female German shepherd, a heroic search and rescue dog. But the true purpose of this dog's life doesn't become totally clear until his reincarnation as Buddy, a black Lab. A book for all age groups who admire canine courage, Cameron also successfully captures the essence of a dog's amazing capacity to love and protect. And happily, unlike Marley, this dog stays around for the long haul. Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."", 'From', 'Booklist', 'Like cats, dogs have multiple lives. At least, Bailey, the canine narrator of this first novel, has more than one. Bailey’s first life is spent as a feral puppy who learns to trust humans after living with a loving but slightly dotty woman who owns too many dogs to suit the county. Bailey is removed by animal control, and his next life brings him to young Ethan, the human Bailey will love and search for through all his subsequent lives, first as part of K-9 Search and Rescue and then as a dumped and mistreated mutt. Through all these lives, Bailey contemplates his purpose in a voice full of curiosity and humor. He ruminates on the usefulness of cats (“none”) and the strange natures of humans (“Am I a good dog or a bad dog? They can’t decide”). This quickly paced, touching novel will charm all animal fans, especially those who loved Garth Stein’s The Art of Racing in the Rain (2009) and Vicki Myron’s Dewey (2008), the best-selling saga of a library cat. --Kaite Mediatore Stover', 'Review', '“I loved the book and I could not put it down.

I was very disappointed. Though my vision had resolved itself only to the point where I could distinguish fuzzy forms in the light, I knew that the large and beautiful shape with the long wonderful tongue was my mother. I had figured out that when the chill air struck my skin it meant she had gone somewhere, but when the warmth returned it would be time to feed. Often finding a place to suckle meant pushing aside what I now knew was the snout of a sibling seeking to crowd me out of my share, which was really irritating. I couldn't see that my brothers and sister had any purpose whatsoever. When my mother licked my stomach to stimulate the flow of fluids from under my tail, I blinked up at her, silently beseeching her to please get rid of the other puppies for me. I wanted her all to myself."", 'Gradually, the other dogs came into focus, and I grudgingly accepted their presence in the nest. My nose soon told me I had one sister and two brothers. Sister was only slightly less interested in wresting with me than my brothers, one of whom I thought of as Fast, because he somehow always moved more quickly than I could. The other one I mentally called Hungry, because he whimpered whenever Mother was gone and would suckle her with an odd desperation, as if it were never enough. Hungry slept more than my siblings and I did, so we often jumped on him and chewed on his face.', ""Our den was scooped out underneath the black roots of a tree, and was cool and dark during the heat of the day. The first time I tottered out into the sunlight, Sister and Fast accompanied me, and naturally Fast shoved his way to the front. Of the four of us, only Fast had a splash of white on his face, and as he trotted jauntily forward this patch of fur flashed in the daylight. I'm special, Fast's dazzling, star- shaped spot seemed to be declaring to the world. The rest of him was as mottled and unremarkably brown and black as I was. Hungry was several shades lighter and Sister shared Mother's stubby nose and flattened forehead, but we all looked more or less the same, despite Fast's prancing."", ""Our tree was perched on a creek bank, and I was delighted when Fast tumbled head over heels down the bank, though Sister and I plummeted with no more grace when we tried to make the same descent. Slippery rocks and a tiny trickle of water offered wonderful odors, and we followed the wet trail of the creek into a moist, cool cave-- a culvert with metal sides. I knew instinctively that this was a good place to hide from danger, but Mother was unimpressed with our find and hauled us unceremoniously back to the Den when it turned out our legs weren't powerful enough to enable us to scale back up the bank."", ""We had learned the lesson that we couldn't return to the nest on our own when we went down the bank, so as soon as Mother left the nest we did it again. This time Hungry joined us, though once he was in the culvert he sprawled in the cool mud and fell asleep."", ""Exploring seemed like the right thing to do-- we needed to find other things to eat. Mother, getting impatient with us, was standing up when we weren't even finished feeding, which I could only blame on the other dogs. If Hungry weren't so relentless, if Fast weren't so bossy, if Sister didn't wiggle so much, I knew Mother would hold still and allow us to fill our bellies."", ""Couldn't I always coax her to lie down, usually with a sigh, when I reached up for her while she stood above us?"", 'Often Mother would spend extra time licking Hungry while I seethed at the injustice.', 'By this time, Fast and Sister had both grown larger than I-- my body was the same size, but my legs were shorter and stubbier.', 'Hungry was the runt of the litter, of course, and it bothered me that Fast and Sister always abandoned me to play with each other, as if Hungry and I belonged together out of some sort of natural order in the pack.', 'Since Fast and Sister were more interested in each other than the rest of the family, I punished them by depriving them of my company, going off by myself deep into the culvert. I was sniffing at something deliciously dead and rotten one day when right in front of me a tiny animal exploded into the air--a frog!', ""Delighted, I leaped forward, attempting to pounce on it with my paws, but the frog jumped again. It was afraid, although all I wanted to do was play and probably wouldn't eat it."", 'Fast and Sister sensed my excitement and came stampeding into the culvert, knocking me over as they skidded to a stop in the slimy water. The frog hopped and Fast lunged at it, using my head as a springboard. I snarled at him, but he ignored me.', 'Sister and Fast fell all over themselves to get at the frog, who managed to land in a pool of water and kick away in silent, rapid strokes. Sister put her muzzle in the pond and snorted, sneezing water over Fast and me. Fast climbed on her back, the frog-- my frog!-- forgotten.', 'Sadly, I turned away. It looked as though I lived in a family of dimwits.', 'I was to think of that frog often in the days that followed, usually just as I drifted off to sleep. I found myself wondering how it would have tasted.', ""More and more frequently, Mother would growl softly when we approached, and the day she clicked her teeth together in warning when we came at her in a greedy tumble I despaired that my siblings had ruined everything. Then Fast crawled to her, his belly low, and she lowered her snout to him. He licked her mouth and she rewarded him by bringing up food, and we rushed forward to share. Fast pushed us away, but we knew the trick, now, and when I sniffed and licked my mother's jaws she gave me a meal."", 'At this point we had all become thoroughly familiar with the creek bed, and had tracked up and down it until the whole area was redolent with our odors. Fast and I spent most of our time dedicated to the serious business of play, and I was beginning to understand how important it was to him for the game to wind up with me on my back, his mouth chewing my face and throat.', ""Sister never challenged him, but I still wasn't sure I liked what everyone seemed to assume was the natural order of our pack."", ""Hungry, of course, didn't care about his status, so when I was frustrated I bit his ears."", ""One afternoon I was drowsily watching Sister and Fast yank on a scrap of cloth they'd found when my ears perked up-- an animal of some kind was coming, something large and loud. I scrambled to my feet, but before I could race down the creek bed to investigate the noise Mother was there, her body rigid with warning. I saw with surprise that she had Hungry in her teeth, carrying him in a fashion that we'd left behind weeks ago."", 'She led us into the dark culvert and crouched down, her ears flat against her head. The message was clear, and we heeded it, shrinking back from the tunnel opening in silence.', ""When the thing came into view, striding along the creek bed, I felt Mother's fear ripple across her back. It was big, it stood on two legs, and an acrid smoke wafted from its mouth as it shambled toward us."", ""I stared intently, absolutely fascinated. For reasons I couldn't fathom I was drawn to this creature, compelled, and I even tensed, preparing to bound out to greet it. One look from my mother, though, and I decided against it. This was something to be feared, to be avoided at all costs."", ""It was, of course, a man. The first one I'd ever seen. The man never glanced in our direction. He scaled the bank and disappeared from view, and after a few moments Mother slid out into the sunlight and raised her head to see if the danger had passed. She relaxed, then, and came back inside, giving each of us a reassuring kiss."", ""I ran out to see for myself, and found myself disheartened when all that remained of the man's presence was a lingering scent of smoke in the air."", ""Over and over again the next few weeks, Mother reinforced the message we'd learned in that culvert: Avoid men at all costs."", 'Fear them.', ""The next time Mother went to hunt, we were allowed to go with her. Once we were away from the security of the Den, her behavior became timid and skittish, and we all emulated her actions. We steered clear of open spaces, slinking along next to bushes. If we saw a person, Mother would freeze, her shoulders tense, ready to run. At these times Fast's patch of white fur seemed as obtrusive as a bark, but no one ever noticed us."", ""Mother showed us how to tear into the filmy bags behind houses, quickly scattering inedible papers and revealing chunks of meat, crusts of bread, and bits of cheese, which we chewed to the best of our ability. The tastes were exotic and the smells were wonderful, but Mother's anxiety affected all of us, and we ate quickly, savoring nothing. Almost immediately Hungry brought up his meal, which I thought was pretty funny until I, too, felt my insides gripped in a powerful spasm."", 'It seemed to go down easier the second time.', ""I'd always been aware of other dogs, though I'd never personally met any except those in my own family. Sometimes when we were out hunting they barked at us from behind fences, most likely jealous that we were trotting around free while they were imprisoned. Mother, of course, never let us approach any of the strangers, while Fast usually bristled a little, somehow insulted that anybody would dare call out to us while he lifted his leg on their trees."", 'Occasionally I even saw a dog in a car! The first time this happened I stared in wonderment at his head hanging out the window, tongue lolling out. He barked joyously when he spotted me, but I was too astounded to do anything but lift my nose and sniff in disbelief.', ""Cars and trucks were something else Mother evaded, though I didn't see how they could be dangerous if there were sometimes dogs inside them. A large, loud truck came around frequently and took away all the bags of food people left out for us, and then meals would be scarce for a day or two. I didn't like that truck, nor the greedy men who hopped off it to scoop up all the food for themselves, despite the fact that they and their truck smelled glorious."", 'There was less time for play, now that we were hunting.', ""Mother snarled when Hungry tried to lick her lips, hoping for a meal, and we all got the message. We went out often, hiding from sight, desperately searching for food. I felt tired and weak, now, and didn't even try to challenge Fast when he stood with his head over my back, thrusting his chest at me. Fine, let him be the boss."", 'As far as I was concerned, my short legs were better suited for the low, slinking run our mother had taught us anyway. If Fast felt he was making some sort of point by using his height to knock me over, he was fooling himself. Mother was the dog in charge.', 'There was barely room for all of us underneath the tree now, and Mother was gone for longer and longer periods of time.', ""Something told me that one of these days she wouldn't come back. We would have to fend for ourselves, Fast always pushing me out of the way, trying to take my share. Mother wouldn't be there to look after me."", 'I began to think of what it would be like to leave the Den.', 'The day everything changed began with Hungry stumbling into the culvert to lie down instead of going on the hunt, his breathing labored, his tongue sticking out of his mouth. Mother nuzzled Hungry before she left, and when I sniffed at him his eyes remained shut.', ""Over the culvert was a road, and along the road we'd once found a large dead bird, which we'd all torn into until Fast picked it up and ran off with it. Despite the danger of being seen, we tended to range up and down this road, looking for more birds, which was what we were doing when Mother suddenly raised her head in alarm. We all heard it the same instant: a truck approaching."", 'But not just any truck-- this same vehicle, making the same sounds, had been back and forth along our road several times the past few days, moving slowly, even menacingly, as if hunting', 'specifically for us.', ""We followed Mother as she darted back to the culvert, but for reasons I'll never fully understand, I stopped and looked back at the monstrous machine, taking an extra few seconds before I followed Mother into the safety of the tunnel."", 'Those few seconds proved to make all the difference-- they had spotted me. With a low, rumbling vibration, the truck came to a stop directly overhead. The engine clanked and went quiet, and then we heard the sounds of boots on gravel.', 'Mother gave a soft whimper.', ""When the human faces appeared at either end of the culvert, Mother went low, tensing her body. They showed their teeth at us, but it didn't seem to be a hostile gesture. Their faces were brown, marked with black hair, black brows, and dark eyes."", '""Here, boy,"" one of them whispered. I didn\'t know what it meant, but the call seemed as natural as the sound of the wind, as if I had been listening to men speak my whole life.', ""Both men had poles, I now saw, poles with ropes looped on the end. They appeared threatening, and I felt Mother's panic boil over. Her claws scrabbling, she bolted, her head down, aiming for the space between the legs of one of the men. The pole came down, there was a quick snap, and then my mother was twisting and jerking as the man hauled her out into the sunlight."", 'Sister and I backed up, cowering, while Fast growled, his fur bristling on the back of his neck. Then it occurred to all three of us that while the way behind us was still blocked, the tunnel mouth in front of us was now clear. We darted forward.', '""Here they come!"" the man behind us yelled.', ""Once out in the creek bed, we realized we didn't really know what to do next. Sister and I stood behind Fast-- he wanted to be the boss, so okay, let him deal with this."", 'There was no sign of Mother. The two men were on opposite banks, though, each wielding his pole. Fast dodged one but then was snagged by the other. Sister took advantage of the melee to escape, her feet splashing in the water as she scampered away, but I stood rooted, staring up at the road.', 'A woman with long white hair stood there above us, her face wrinkled in kindness. ""Here, puppy, it\'s okay. You\'ll be all right.', 'Here, puppy,"" she said.', ""I didn't run; I didn't move. I allowed the loop of rope to slip over my face and tighten on my neck. The pole guided me up the bank, where the man seized me by the scruff of the neck."", '""He\'s okay; he\'s okay,"" the woman crooned. ""Let him go.""', '""He\'ll run off,"" the man warned.', '""Let him go.""', 'I followed this bit of dialogue without comprehension, only understanding that somehow the woman was in charge, though she was older and smaller than either of the two men. With a reluctant grunt, the man lifted the rope off my neck. The woman offered her hands to me: rough, leathery palms coated with a flowery smell. I sniffed them, then lowered my head. A clear sense of caring and concern radiated off of her.', 'When she ran her fingers along my fur I felt a shiver pass through me. My tail whipped the air of its own accord, and when she astonished me by lifting me into the air I scrambled to kiss her face, delighting in her laughter.', ""The mood turned somber when one of the men approached, holding Hungry's limp body. The man showed it to the woman, who clucked mournfully. Then he took it to the truck, where Mother and Fast were in a metal cage, and held it up to their noses. The scent of death, recognizable to me as any memory, wafted off of Hungry in the dry, dusty air."", 'We all carefully smelled my dead brother, and I understood the men wanted us to know what had happened to Hungry.', ""Sadness came from all of them as they stood there silently in the road, but they didn't know how sick Hungry had been, sick from birth and not long for the world."", ""I was put in the cage, and Mother sniffed disapprovingly at the woman's smell, which had been pressed into my fur. With a lurch, the truck started up again, and I was quickly distracted by the wonderful odors flowing through the cage as we moved down the road. I was riding in a truck! I barked in delight, Fast and Mother jerking their heads in surprise at my outburst. I couldn't help myself; it was the most exciting thing that had ever happened in my whole life, including almost catching the frog."", 'Fast seemed overcome with sadness, and it took me a moment to understand: Sister, his favorite companion, was gone, as lost to us as was Hungry.', ""There was, I reflected, much more complexity to the world than I had supposed. It wasn't just about Mother and my siblings hiding from people, hunting, and playing in the culvert. Larger events had the ability to change everything-- events that were controlled by human beings."", ""I was wrong about one thing: though we didn't know it at the time, Fast and I would meet up with Sister again in the future."", 'Copyright © 2010 by W.

Emperor: The Gates of Rome (Emperor Series Book 1);"['About the Author', 'Conn Iggulden is a British author who writes historical fiction, most notably the Emperor series and Conqueror series. He also co-authored The Dangerous Book for Boys along with his brother Hal Iggulden. In 2007, Iggulden became the first person to top the UK fiction and non-fiction charts at the same time.', '--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.', 'From Publishers Weekly', 'If the Roman Empire had taken as long to rise and fall as this novel takes to discover a main character and a plot, most of the world would still be wearing togas today. The story, such as it is, revolves around two boys: Gaius, the broody son of a wealthy senator, and Marcus, a prostitute\'s mischievous child who is reared as Gaius\'s brother and trained with him in the arts of war. Before the two boys reach majority, they are thrust into adulthood by the untimely death of Gaius\'s father and take up residence in Rome with Gaius\'s uncle Marius, a powerful consul who is vying with Sulla for control of the Republic. When Marcus is 14, he joins the Fourth Macedonian Legion to earn his fortune; Gaius remains by his uncle\'s side. Iggulden lingers long over boyhood pranks, trying the reader\'s patience; the pace picks up only halfway through the novel. Frequent fight scenes, ranging from individual combat to full scale battles, liven the mix somewhat, but the cartoon-like ability of the characters to bounce back after a few stitches weakens the effect. Though Iggulden has a solid grounding in Roman military history, anachronisms in speech and attitude (""Cabera took him outside and gave him a hiding"") roll underfoot and trip up authenticity. A major twist toward the end reveals the protagonists to be two of Roman history\'s best-known figures, but readers with some knowledge of the period will have guessed their identities already. This is ultimately little more than a protracted introduction to a bigger story, which Iggulden will surely go on to tell. Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.', '--This text refers to an alternate', 'kindle_edition', 'edition.', 'From Library Journal', ""English writer Iggulden's first novel is the story of two young boys-Gaius and Marcus, raised as brothers though one is illegitimate-as they grow to adulthood in Rome two millennia ago. At that time, the republic was beginning to fall apart, a collapse that would result in the civil wars that brought the emperors to power. It was a time of turmoil, chaos, revolutions, casual violence, and savage brutality, and Iggulden's descriptions of the culture and environment are vivid. Although covering a period unknown to most lay readers, Emperor is a surprisingly fast and often exciting read. Iggulden admits to taking some liberties with history, and his masking the identities of Gaius and Marcus is unnecessary and distracting. While the real identity of Marcus (Et tu, Brute?) may be a puzzle, readers with a fair knowledge of Roman history will quickly identify Gaius (think of the Ides of March). Also, the roles of historical warlords Marius and Sulla are not well clarified. Still, this entertaining historical novel will appeal to fans of Steven Pressfield and Michael Curtis Ford.

Conn Iggulden is just such a writer, bringing to vivid life one of the most fascinating eras in human history. In a true masterpiece of historical fiction, Iggulden takes us on a breathtaking journey through ancient Rome, sweeping us into a realm of tyrants and slaves, of dark intrigues and seething passions. What emerges is both a grand romantic tale of coming-of-age in the Roman Empire and a vibrant portrait of the early years of a man who would become the most powerful ruler on earth: Julius Caesar.On the lush Italian peninsula, a new empire is taking shape. At its heart is the city of Rome, a place of glory and decadence, beauty and bloodshed. Against this vivid backdrop, two boys are growing to manhood, dreaming of battles, fame, and glory in service of the mightiest empire the world has ever known. One is the son of a senator, a boy of privilege and ambition to whom much has been given and from whom much is expected. The other is a bastard child, a boy of strength and cunning, whose love for his adoptive family?and his adoptive brother?will be the most powerful force in his life.As young Gaius and Marcus are trained in the art of combat?under the tutelage of one of Rome?s most fearsome gladiators?Rome itself is being rocked by the art of treachery and ambition, caught in a tug-of-war as two rival generals, Marius and Sulla, push the empire toward civil war. For Marcus, a bloody campaign in Greece will become a young soldier?s proving ground. For Gaius, the equally deadly infighting of the Roman Senate will be the battlefield where he hones his courage and skill. And for both, the love of an extraordinary slave girl will be an honor each will covet but only one will win.The two friends are forced to walk different paths, and by the time they meet again everything will have changed. Both will have known love, loss, and violence. And the land where they were once innocent will be thrust into the grip of bitter conflict?a conflict that will set Roman against Roman...and put their friendship to the ultimate test. Brilliantly interweaving history and adventure, Conn Iggulden conjures a stunning array of contrasts?from the bloody stench of a battlefield to the opulence of the greatest city in history, from the tenderness of a lover to the treachery of an assassin.

The taller of the two had blue eyes that seemed unnaturally bright against the cracking, itching mud that plastered him.""We\'re going to be killed for this, Marcus,"" he said, grinning. In his hand, a sling spun lazily, held taut with the weight of a smooth river pebble.""Your fault, Gaius, for pushing me in. I told you the riverbed wasn\'t dry all the way.""As he spoke, the shorter boy laughed and shoved his friend into the bushes that lined the path. He whooped and ran as Gaius scrambled out and set off in pursuit, sling whirring in a disc.""Battle!"" he shouted in his high, unbroken voice.The beating they would get at home for ruining their tunics was far away, and both boys knew every trick to get out of trouble--all that mattered was charging through the woodland paths at high speed, scaring birds. Both boys were barefoot, already with calluses developing, despite not having seen more than eight summers.""This time, I\'ll catch him,"" Gaius panted to himself as he ran. It was a mystery to him how Marcus, who had the same number of legs and arms, could yet somehow make them move faster than he could. In fact, as he was shorter, his stride should have been a little less, surely?The leaves whipped by him, stinging his bare arms. He could hear Marcus taunting him up ahead, close. Gaius showed his teeth as his lungs began to hurt.Without warning, he broke into a clearing at full pelt and skidded to a sudden, shocked stop. Marcus was lying on the ground, trying to sit up and holding his head in his right hand. Three men--no, older boys--were standing there, carrying walking staffs.Gaius groaned as he took in his surroundings. The chase had carried the two boys off his father\'s small estate and into their neighbors\' part of the woods. He should have recognized the track that marked the boundary, but he\'d been too caught up in catching Marcus for once.""What do we have here? A couple of little mudfish, crawled up out of the river!""It was Suetonius who spoke, the eldest son of the neighboring estate. He was fourteen and killing time before he went into the army. He had the sort of trained muscles the two younger boys hadn\'t begun to develop. He had a mop of blond hair over a face speckled with white-headed eruptions that covered his cheeks and forehead, with a sprinkling of angry-looking red ones disappearing under his praetexta tunic. He also had a long, straight stick, friends to impress, and an afternoon to while away.Gaius was frightened, knowing he was out of his depth. He and Marcus were trespassing--the best they could expect was a few blows, the worst was a beating with broken bones. He glanced at Marcus and saw him try to stagger to his feet. He\'d obviously been belted with something as he ran into the older boys.""Let us go, Tonius, we\'re expected back.""""Speaking mudfish! We\'ll make our fortune, boys! Grab hold of them, I have a roll of twine for tying up pigs that will do just as well for mudfish.""Gaius didn\'t consider running, with Marcus unable to get away. This wasn\'t a game--the cruelty of the boys could be managed if they were treated carefully, talked to like scorpions, ready to strike without warning.The two other boys approached with their staffs held ready. They were both strangers to Gaius. One dragged Marcus to his feet and the other, a hefty, stupid-looking boy, rammed his stick into Gaius\'s stomach. He doubled up in agony, unable to speak. He could hear the boy laughing as he cramped and groaned, trying to curl into the pain.""There\'s a branch that will do. Tie their legs together and string them up to swing. We can see who\'s the best shot with javelins and stones.""""Your father knows my father,"" Gaius spat out as the pain in his stomach lessened.""True--doesn\'t like him though. My father is a proper patrician, not like yours. Your whole family could be his servants if he wanted. I\'d make that mad mother of yours scrub the tiles.""At least he was talking. The thug with the horsehair twine was intent on tying knots at Gaius\'s feet, ready to hoist him into the air. What could he say to bargain? His father had no real power in the city. His mother\'s family had produced a couple of consuls--that was it. Uncle Marius was a powerful man, so his mother said.""We are nobilitas--my uncle Marius is not a man to cross . . .""There was a sudden high-pitched yelp as the string over the branch went tight and Marcus was swung into the air upside down.""Tie the end to that stump. This fish next,"" Tonius said, laughing gleefully.Gaius noted that the two friends followed his orders without question. It would be pointless trying to appeal to one of them.""Let us down, you spot-covered pus-bag!"" Marcus shouted as his face darkened with the rush of blood.Gaius groaned. Now they would be killed, he was sure.""You idiot, Marcus. Don\'t mention his spots; you can see he must be sensitive about them.""Suetonius raised an eyebrow and his mouth opened in astonishment. The heavyset boy paused in throwing the twine over a second branch.""Oh, you have made a mistake, little fish. Finish stringing that one up, Decius, I\'m going to make him bleed a little.""Suddenly, the world tilted sickeningly and Gaius could hear the twine creak and a low whistle in his ears as his head filled with blood. He rotated slowly and came round to see Marcus in a similar predicament. His nose was a little bloody from being knocked down the first time.""I think you\'ve stopped my nosebleed, Tonius. Thanks."" Marcus\'s voice trembled slightly and Gaius smiled at his bravery.When he\'d first come to live with them, the little boy had been naturally nervous and a little small for his age. Gaius had shown him around the estate and they\'d ended up in the hay barn, right at the top of the stacked sheaves. They had looked down at the loose pile far below and Gaius had seen Marcus\'s hands tremble.""I\'ll go first and show you how it\'s done,"" Gaius had said cheerfully, launching himself feetfirst and whooping.Below, he\'d looked up at the edge for a few seconds, waiting to see Marcus appear. Just as he\'d thought it would never happen, a small figure shot into the air, leaping high. Gaius had scrambled out of the way as Marcus crashed into the hay, winded and gasping.""I thought you were too scared to do it,"" Gaius had said to the prone figure blinking in the dust.""I was,"" Marcus had replied quietly, ""but I won\'t be afraid. I just won\'t.""The hard voice of Suetonius broke into Gaius\'s spinning thoughts: ""Gentlemen, meat must be tenderized with mallets. Take your stations and begin the technique, like so.""He swung his stick at Gaius\'s head, catching him over the ear. The world went white, then black, and when he next opened his eyes everything was spinning as the string twisted. For a while, he could feel the blows as Suetonius called out, ""One-two-three, one-two-three . . .""He thought he could hear Marcus crying and then he passed out to the accompaniment of jeers and laughter.He woke and went back under a couple of times in the daylight, but it was dusk when he was finally able to stay conscious. His right eye was a heavy mass of blood, and his face felt swollen and caked in stickiness. They were still upside down and swinging gently as the evening breeze came in from the hills.""Wake up, Marcus--Marcus!""His friend didn\'t stir. He looked terrible, like some sort of demon. The crust of crumbling river mud had been broken away, and there was now only a gray dust, streaked with red and purple. His jaw was swollen, and a lump stood out on his temple. His left hand was fat and had a bluish tinge in the failing light. Gaius tried to move his own hands, held by the twine. Though painfully stiff, they both worked and he set about wriggling them free. His young frame was supple and the burst of fresh pain was ignored in the wave of worry he felt for his friend. He had to be all right, he had to be. First, though, Gaius had to get down.One hand came free and he reached down to the ground, scrabbling in the dust and dead leaves with his fingertips. Nothing. The other hand came free and he widened his area of search, making his body swing in a slow circle. Yes, a small stone with a sharp edge. Now for the difficult part.""Marcus! Can you hear me? I\'m going to get us down, don\'t you worry. Then I\'m going to kill Suetonius and his fat friends.""Marcus swung gently in silence, his mouth open and slack. Gaius took a deep breath and readied himself for the pain. Under normal circumstances, reaching up to cut through a piece of heavy twine with only a sharp stone would have been difficult, but with his abdomen a mass of bruises, it felt like an impossible task.Go.He heaved himself up, crying out with the pain from his stomach. He jackknifed up to the branch and gripped it with both hands, lungs heaving with the effort. He felt weak and his vision blurred. He thought he would vomit, and could do no more than just hold on for a few moments. Then, inch by inch, he released the hand with the stone and leaned back, giving himself enough room to reach the twine and saw at it, trying not to catch his skin where it had bitten into the flesh.The stone was depressingly blunt and he couldn\'t hold on for long. Gaius tried to let go before his hands slipped so he could control the fall back, but it was too hard.""Still got the stone,"" he muttered to himself.

Born into a patrician family, Caesar was catapulted into managing the family estate at an early age, when his father was killed during a slave revolt. The author focuses on Caesar's training for battle--a typical endeavor for his age and ilk.

The Floating Islands;"['About the Author', ""RACHEL NEUMEIER is the author of several fantasy novels, for both adults and young adults, including Knopf's"", 'The City in the Lake', '.', 'The Floating Islands', 'is her second YA book.', 'From the Hardcover edition.', 'Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved.', 'Neumeier: THE FLOATING ISLANDS  1  Trei was fourteen the first time he saw the Floating Islands. He had made the whole long voyage south from Rounn in a haze of loss and misery, not really noticing the harbors in which the ship sometimes anchored or the sea between. But here, where both sea and sky lay pearl-gray in the dawn, the wonder of the Floating Islands broke at last into that haze.  A boy high in the rigging called out in a shrill voice, pointing, and then the deeper voice of an officer rang out and the ship smoothly adjusted its heading. Before them, the Islands rose shimmering out of the dawn mist. They stood high above the sea—too high, even in that first mist-shrouded glimpse. Then the early sun, rising, turned the air to gold and the sea to sapphire and picked the Islands out of the mist like jewels. In that light, they seemed too beautiful to hold terror or despair or anguish. Trei could hardly bear to look at them, yet could not bring himself to look away. He gripped the railing hard and bit his lip almost till it bled.  Each of the Floating Islands was broad on top, narrowing to points of jagged rock below. Trei found a place to sit among coiled ropes, near the bow of the ship, out of the way of the busy sailors. He propped his chin in his hands and watched the Islands grow larger as the morning passed. They only seemed more astonishing as the ship approached them. Trei could have believed that someone had painted them on a backdrop and the ship would eventually tear through the canvas to find, waiting, a far less magical scene.  The Islands proved to be farther away than Trei had first thought. All morning, while the dawn cool gave way to the heavy southern heat, the ship sailed toward the nearest of the Islands, drawing close at last only as the sun crested in the sky. Pastures scattered with grazing sheep were visible upon its heights as they approached it, and the fluted pillars of a temple. Trei found his eye persistently trying to fill in the slopes of a mountain below the floating stone, but no matter how he stared, the red rock ran out into nothing but empty air where the gulls wheeled.  Trei craned his neck back and stared upward as they passed under the Island. Drifting mist, contorted trees growing directly out of the rock, gulls’ nests, and the odd vein of white marble, all so high above there would have been room below for masts five times the height. Barely audible beyond the shrill cries of the gulls came the delicate thread of some unearthly melody.  “That’s only Talabri,” Mana said, stopping beside Trei. The burly sailor’s tone was dismissive; Trei looked at him with mute amazement that anyone could sound like that while sailing hardly a long stone’s throw from such a miracle.  “Sheep and shepherds, orchards and vineyards, temples and priests.” Mana waved Talabri away with scorn. He enjoyed talking and never minded Trei’s silence. Despite his own distracted indifference, Trei had come to like the sailor’s friendly one-sided conversation. “It’s peaceful, aye, but there’s nothing on Talabri to interest a man. Candera, now—where’s your family, lad, Candera?”  Trei closed his eyes briefly, wishing desperately that his family was on Candera, was anywhere at all in the living world. It took him a moment to manage anything like a normal tone. “Milendri. My uncle’s family.”  “Oh, Milendri! That’s lucky for you, lad, supposing you want to live on an island held up in the air by nothing but sky magic. But Milendri’s the greatest of all the Floating Islands, they say. Your uncle’s family lives in Canpra, I suppose, the king’s capital city, what’s his name—some up-and-down Island name, nothing but vowels from start to finish.”  The king of the Floating Islands was Terinai Naterensei, but Trei said nothing. His uncle’s family did indeed live in a city called Canpra, but Trei hadn’t really understood that this was anything special.  Mana, never deterred by Trei’s silence, went on cheerfully, “I hear Canpra’s a splendid city. Not that they let ships’ crews up, but they say the old king, three back, built it to rival even Rodounnè. Not that I believe it. But it’s true the bit you can see from the sea looks splendid enough.”  Trei wondered how a city would look if it was deliberately built to be splendid. In Tolounn, all the towns had just sort of grown up where people had once decided to settle, like the town of Rounn growing up around the Rounn River, where, according to family legend, Great-grandfather Meraunn had once made his fortune backing the new steamboats over ox-drawn keelboats. He found he was curious about this new city, but didn’t know exactly what to ask.  “We won’t see Milendri before tomorrow afternoon,” Mana rattled on. “We’ll be passing islands all day, of course. . . .”  But Trei was no longer listening. He had just caught sight of his first winged Island fliers, and had attention to spare for nothing else.  There were a dozen of them—no, Trei saw as they approached: fourteen. Fifteen. They flew as geese fly in the fall, in a formation like a spear point. At first the shape the winged men made was stark as a rune against the empty sky, but as they approached the ship, they broke their formation, wheeled, and circled low. The morning light caught in the feathers of their glorious wings, crimson as blood, except for one man whose wings were black as grief.  As the fliers passed above the ship, Trei saw how each man wore his wings like a strange kind of cloak. Crimson bands crossed the fliers’ arms and bodies. Though the wings looked like real wings, he saw clearly that the men were flying by some understandable kind of magic and were not actually winged people.', 'From the Hardcover edition.']";5.98;Rachel Neumeier (Author);['Books', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction'];{'Publisher': 'Bluefire (April 10, 2012)', 'Language': 'English', 'Paperback': '400 pages', 'ISBN 10': '0440240603', 'ISBN 13': '978-0440240600', 'Reading age': '12 - 15 years', 'Grade level': '7 - 9', 'Item Weight': '12 ounces', 'Dimensions': '5.62 x 0.88 x 8.23 inches'};0440240603

Duck Alley;"['From Publishers Weekly', ""A nostalgic revisiting of childhood shenanigans during the 1950s and '60s in a tough section of Long Island called Duck Alley turns sinister when a murder committed years later, in 1973, divides the narrator, Jay Tasti, whose family is Italian, from his lifelong buddy, Hungarian immigrant Albert Niklozak. The two meet in grade school, and they are so close that when Albert is in basic training, he calls Jay instead of his mother. Later, Jay becomes a high school English teacher, while Albert earns his livelihood as a small-time fence and pimp. Jay meets his future wife, Annetta, while both are working at a warehouse Albert manages. When Jay's troubled student, the aggressively flirtatious Arlynn Svenson, unsuccessfully tries to seduce him, and then claims she's pregnant, Jay asks for Albert's help. Arlynn ends up dead. The actual sequence of events is unclear, and though Albert's guilt seems evident, the observer is left with doubts. Those doubts drive the story forward and the characters apart, as Jay feels obliged to testify against Albert. To Jay, the mystery is only part of the larger story of his conflicted relationship with Albert, in which manifestations of love, trust and honor are not always what they seem. The story is excellently paced and imaginatively told, in a series of flashbacks, imaginary scenarios and straightforward narrative sections, all enlivened with vernacular dialogue. DeFilippi's (Blood Sugar) novel is as much about emotions as it is about actions, and it delivers a jolt of a surprise ending that entirely fits the plot's milieu. (Sept.) Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc."", 'From School Library Journal', ""YA-A book that grabs readers quickly and doesn't let go. Jay Tasti was raised in Duck Alley, a working-class suburb on Long Island, in the 1950s. His closest boyhood friend was the daring and dangerous Albert Nikozak, who grows up to be a thug who takes care of his friends. Jay becomes a teacher and runs into problems with a troubled student. Arlynn Svenson often fabricates stories with herself as victim and an unsuspecting male as the perpetrator. She tells Jay that she is pregnant with his child, even though they have never been intimate. Jay worries about losing his job, his reputation, and his wife when Arlynn decides to blare her lies. He turns to Albert for help. When Arlynn is discovered miles away, dead, Jay undergoes a crisis of conscience, for he knows that his friend killed her. Readers are given broad hints throughout that eventually something terrible happens. Jay, the narrator, almost reveals what is going on, then reverts to describing a memory that further illuminates the two men. Albert is a sort of modern-day tragic Greek figure, bound to end in ruin due to his own character flaws, but one with strangely redeeming qualities. Jay has weaknesses of his own. The writing is concise and pithy and rings true. Both the child and adult versions of Jay and Albert have problems and personality quirks that teens will recognize. The story will lead to much stimulating discussion."", 'Carol DeAngelo, Kings Park Library, Burke, VA', 'Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.', 'From', 'Booklist', 'Two friends grow up in a tough Long Island neighborhood in the 1950s and 1960s. One becomes an English teacher, the other a pimp. When a tragic and ultimately meaningless crime is committed, the putative bad guy takes the fall. From this rather cliched premise, DeFilippi creates a surprisingly fresh novel. The story evolves into a meditation on communication (between spouses and between men) and on silence, especially as manifested in the', 'Omerata', "", the infamous underworld code of secrecy. At several points in the story, a modicum of honesty could prevent tragedy, but the people involved simply don't have that skill in their repertoires. DeFilippi's schoolteacher, no sanctimonious do-gooder, is full of texture and self-doubt; his thug is a Vietnam veteran from a family of Hungarian refugees. The flashbacks to early television and the vicious nuns in the Catholic school are more cautionary than nostalgic, and the Long Island setting is evoked vividly but with admirable restraint. A sleeper that could find its natural audience among public-library fiction devotees."", 'George Needham', 'From Kirkus Reviews', ""A second from DeFilippi has parallels with his considerably stronger Blood Sugar (1992), but too much in plot flies off with too little in substantive atmosphere or theme to act as ballast. Narrator Jay Tasti opens up with a ramble through plentifully familiar boyhood memories of growing up on Duck Alley, Long Island. Recalling the happy summertime of his youth in the 50s, Tasti summons Coke bottles, friendly drunks, fussy moms, baseball games on the radio and harmless pranks. Back then, see, Tasti was real tight with Albert Niklozak, and, man, did they do some crazy stuff. Well. Then comes the draft. Albert gets sent to Nam (and strangely never speaks of it), while Tasti stays comfy with a stateside role. Tasti muffles his mixed feelings, becomes a high-school teacher, and marries. Albert becomes a small-time hood dealing in fenced goods and prostitutes. As for his life in education, Tasti recalls, oh, if there only hadn't been Arlynn Svenson . . . . Arlynn, the cartoonishly drawn high-school sex siren with a troubled mind, finds teacher Tasti on the beach during a field trip, bares her breasts to him, and actually says ``jiggle, jiggle.'' Though Tasti takes a hundred pages to not touch her breasts, Arlynn, while literally flopping around in the hall and driving everyone nuts, claims Tasti got her pregnant. Blow her off? Advise therapy? Nah, do the sensible thing, and get Albert to silence her. It seems Albert does what hes asked, gets caught, sent to jail, then killed in a knife fight. Only after all that does Tasti discover that Albert never murdered the girlbut held his tongue for the honor of friendship, which Tasti grieves to have forgotten. The depth of Tasti's spiritual agony is doubtless meant to be profound, but the story just doesnt make it real, with the result that the profound and the inane are at loggerheads. --"", 'Copyright ©1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

A few weeks before Christmas, 1895, Emily Radley, the sister of Charlotte Pitt (last seen with husband, Thomas Pitt, in', 'Buckingham Palace Gardens', ""), answers a summons from Father Tyndale, spiritual leader of a small Western Ireland community. The Catholic priest is concerned about Emily's dying aunt, Susannah Ross, who's been estranged from her family since marrying outside their Protestant faith. Once in Ireland, Emily finds her aunt's entire village in the grip of fear, haunted by a secret. A shipwreck during a ferocious storm, the rescue of a young man from the sea's clutches and another young man's mysterious murder complicate Emily's mission.

The decorations were already planned: the bows, the colored balls, the tinsel, the little glass icicles, and the red and green shiny birds. At the foot would be the brightly wrapped presents for her husband and children.All through the house there would be candles, wreaths and garlands of holly and ivy. There would be bowls of crystallized fruit and porcelain dishes of nuts, jugs of mulled wine, plates of mince pies, roasted chestnuts, and, of course, great fires in the hearths with apple logs to burn with a sweet smell.The year of 1895 had not been an easy one, and she was happy enough to see it come to a close. Because they were staying in London, rather than going to the country, there would be parties, and dinners, including the Duchess of Warwick’s; everyone she knew would be at that dinner. And there would be balls where they would dance all night. She had her gown chosen: the palest possible green, embroidered with gold. And, of course, there was the theater. It would not be the same without anything of Oscar Wilde’s, but there would be Goldsmith’s She Stoops to Conquer, and that was fun.She was still thinking about it when Jack came in. He looked a little tired, but he had the same easy grace of manner as always. He was holding a letter in his hand.“Post?” she asked in surprise. “At this time in the evening?” Her heart sank. “It’s not some government matter, is it? They can’t want you now. It’s less than three weeks till Christmas.”“It’s for you,” he replied, holding it out for her. “It was just delivered. I think it’s Thomas’s handwriting.”Thomas Pitt was Emily’s brother-in-law, a policeman. Her sister, Charlotte, had married considerably beneath her. She had not regretted it for a day, even if it had cost her the social and financial comforts she had been accustomed to. On the contrary, it was Emily who envied Charlotte the opportunities she had been given to involve herself in some of his cases. It seemed like far too long since Emily had shared an adventure, the danger, the emotion, the anger, and the pity. Somehow she felt less alive for it.She tore open the envelope and read the paper inside.Dear Emily,I am very sorry to tell you that Charlotte received a letter today from a Roman Catholic priest, Father Tyndale, who lives in a small village in the Connemara region of Western Ireland. He is the pastor to Susannah Ross, your father’s younger sister. She is now widowed again, and Father Tyndale says she is very ill. In fact this will certainly be her last Christmas.I know she parted from the family in less than happy circumstances, but we should not allow her to be alone at such a time. Your mother is in Italy, and unfortunately Charlotte has a bad case of bronchitis, which is why I am writing to ask you if you will go to Ireland to be with Susannah. I realize it is a great sacrifice, but there is no one else.Father Tyndale says it cannot be for long, and you would be most welcome in Susannah’s home.

What does he say?”Wordlessly she passed the letter to him.He read it, frowning, and then offered it back to her. “I’m sorry. I know you were looking forward to Christmas at home, but there’ll be another one next year.”“I’m not going!” she said incredulously.He said nothing, just looked at her steadily.“It’s ridiculous,” she protested. “I can’t go to Connemara, for heaven’s sake. Especially not at Christmas. It’ll be like the end of the world. In fact it is the end of the world. Jack, it’s nothing but freezing bog.”“Actually I believe the west coast of Ireland is quite temperate,” he corrected her. “But wet, of course,” he added with a smile.She breathed out a sigh of relief. His smile could still charm her more than she wished him to know. If he did, he might be impossible to manage at all. She turned away to put the letter on the table. “I’ll write to Thomas tomorrow and explain to him.”“What will you say?” he asked.She was surprised. “That it’s out of the question, of course. But I’ll put it nicely.”“How nicely can you say that you’ll let your aunt die alone at Christmas because you don’t fancy the Irish climate?” he asked, his voice surprisingly gentle, considering the words.Emily froze. She turned back to look at him, and knew that in spite of the smile, he meant exactly what he had said. “Do you really want me to go away to Ireland for the entire Christmas?” she asked. “Susannah’s only fifty. She might live for ages. He doesn’t even say what’s wrong with her.”“One can die at any age,” Jack pointed out. “And what I would like has nothing to do with what is right.”“What about the children?” Emily played the trump card. “What will they think if I leave them for Christmas? It is a time when families should be together.” She smiled back at him.“Then write and tell your aunt to die alone because you want to be with your family,” he replied. “On second thoughts, you’ll have to tell the priest, and he can tell her.”The appalling realization hit her. “You want me to go!” she accused him.', 'Read more']";11.99;Anne Perry (Author);['Books', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery'];"{'Publisher': 'Ballantine Books; 1st edition (October 28, 2008)', 'Language': 'English', 'Hardcover': '224 pages', 'ISBN 10': '0345502035', 'ISBN 13': '978-0345502032', 'Item Weight': '10.4 ounces', 'Dimensions': '5.28 x 0.75 x 7.75 inches'}";0345502035

War Songs and Poems of the Southern Confederacy 1861-1865;"['From the Author', 'A popular and characteristic feature of every war is its literature - in poetry and song. ""The Marseillaise Hymn"" stirred the heart of France as never before; Cromwell, with his Puritans, went forth to battle singing their halleluahs of praise; who that lived amid the days of \'61 does not remember the little Irishman, Henry McCarty, who sent forth throughout the Southern states singing to the assembled multitudes ""The Bonnie Blue Flag"" until they went wild with excitement? What soldier in the Southern states has has not had every nerve thrilled as the band would strike up ""Dixie""? It is true that we cannot find much evidence of genius at such times, nor the production of nature and thoughtful study. Such poems and songs are sparks and flames from the fires of war, and high literary merit must not be expected. But if you wish to find the hearts of the people you will hear it in their songs. It has been a delightful task to me in the past year to collect from all q! uarters of the South these songs and poems, and so to rescue from oblivion the productions which are dear to every Southern heart and home. Nor is it confined alone to the South, for in the North, and even in some other lands, people listen with glad interest to the war songs of those days.', 'These songs and poems belong to the Nation.

Shiksa;"['About the Author', 'I was born in Cologne, Germany shortly before Adolph Hitler became the Chancellor in 1933. The bombings attacks on Cologne by the Allies forced my family to relocate several times. In spite of the devastation, I completed high school at the age of fifteen and entered the Art Academy of the University of Cologne where I became skilled at painting and sculpting. World War II had a great influence on my adolescence and the rest of my life. As refugees, our family was relocated to Erlangen where I became a driver for German military officers during the final stages of the war. Shortly thereafter, I was employed as an artist by the United States Army, working in the same building that had housed my German employers. After falling in love with a young American officer, I became a war bride and left Germany in 1947 to immigrate to the United States. My life in the United States included fashion modeling and assisting my husband with his Ph.D. dissertation. While in Paris, doing research at the Bibliothèque Nationale for my husband\'s thesis, I continued my modeling career and we enjoyed the rich cultural life of Paris. After my husband\'s education was completed, I earned a BA and an MA in art history from the California State University at Los Angeles with minors in psychology and philosophy. I taught at a Los Angeles high school where I created their curriculum in normal and abnormal psychology; Because of my wartime experiences, I had a natural antipathy against biases which made my classes very popular in that school. In June of 1973 I received a Certificate of Recognition from the NAACP. Art in one form or another is the driving force in my life. Writing ""Shiksa"" has fulfilled a life-long ambition. There is very little written about WWII from the point of view of a child of ""the enemy."" Readers of the manuscript wanted to know, ""What happened after you left Germany?""

Did she want to leave us behind?""', 'Her father answered. ""I know you\'re angry, Emily. You\'ve got a lot to be angry about. No, Mom didn\'t want to die. She wanted more than anything to be here with us right now."" He pulled a stool up next to her and sat down.', '""Those women today meant well. They\'re sad about Mom, too. She was their friend, and they\'re just trying to say something nice. People deal with sadness in different ways. Sometimes people say those things because it makes them feel better. Many people loved Mom and miss her a lot. It\'s hard to know the right thing to say to someone who feels sad, and people just do the best they can.""', '""Some kids at school don\'t say anything at all to me. They just look at me funny or whisper when I walk by,"" Emily admitted. ""At least Anna and Grace are still my friends. They still play with me.""', '""I\'m sorry that some kids have acted that way, Emily. That must be really hard for you. I\'m sure those kids feel sad about Mom, too. They might also feel embarrassed because they want to help but don\'t always know what to say. Often, when people don\'t know what to say, they don\'t say anything at all. I know that can be hurtful. Some kids also might be scared and confused. They might worry that what happened to Mom will happen to someone they love. I hope that with time, the other kids will follow Anna\'s and Grace\'s example and not treat you any differently.""', 'Emily hung her head down, unable to meet her father\'s eyes. In a whisper, she said, ""Sometimes I\'m so angry at her for leaving us. Does that make me a bad person?""', 'Her father brushed back a stray piece of hair that had fallen in her eyes. ""You\'re not a bad person for feeling angry. It\'s very hard to lose someone you love. It\'s okay to feel sad and scared, and even angry, too. We have so many feelings inside of us. They\'re all okay. Talking about it can help you feel better. I\'m always here to listen. Don\'t be afraid to tell me how you feel.""', 'Emily hugged her father, and the warmth of his arms comforted her. She felt so many things, and her feelings were all jumbled up inside her. It was hard to know how to sort them all out. But now, she just felt tired and didn\'t want to talk anymore. She rested her head on his chest. ""I love you, Emily,"" he said. ""We\'ll get through this together.""', '* * *', 'Ben', 'had wrapped himself tightly in his favorite blanket, the one his mother had made. He was sitting on the floor next to his bed when he heard a knock on the door. His father stepped into the room and joined Ben on the floor.', '""Hey buddy,"" his father said quietly.', 'Ben clutched his blanket even tighter and scowled.', '""You want to talk about it?"" his father asked.', 'Ben nodded. ""Why is Emily so mean to me? She\'s mad all the time and doesn\'t want to play with me."" As a single tear ran down his cheek, he whispered, ""Did I do something wrong? Was it my fault that Mom died? Is that why Emily\'s so mad at me?""', 'His father put his arm around Ben and said, ""No, Ben. It\'s no one\'s fault — not yours, not mine, not Emily\'s.""', ""Ben didn't realize he'd been holding his breath waiting for an answer. He breathed out, and soon his cheeks were wet with tears."", 'His father paused, searching for the right words. ""Sometimes, people get sick. Most of the time, they get better. But, in some cases, no matter what anyone does to help, they still die."" He continued, ""Emily is not mad at you, Ben. She\'s angry and upset that Mom died. Sometimes when people are hurting, they take it out on those around them — even the people they love.""', 'Ben sucked in his breath to try to stop crying as he wiped his wet face. He listened as his father continued.', '""We\'re all upset that Mom died, though sometimes we have different ways of showing it. The important thing, Ben, is to let your feelings out and not keep them inside.""', 'He looked directly at Ben. ""It\'s okay to cry when sad things happen.""', '""Even for boys?"" Ben asked.', '""Even for boys,"" his father said with certainty. ""Even I cry sometimes. It\'s much better to let your feelings out than to keep them locked up inside. You can always talk to me about how you feel. Nana and Papa, too. We\'re always here for you.""', 'His father held Ben close before he stood up and said, ""I\'ll be right back; I have something for you.""', 'He was only gone a moment before he returned with a cloth bag. He sat back down on the floor. He reached inside the bag and retrieved a small narrow box and handed it to Ben.', ""The leather box was smooth to the touch. As his father opened it, Ben recognized the slender, shiny object inside. It was his mother's fountain pen. Ben picked up the pen; it felt cool in his hand."", '""It\'s Mom\'s special pen,"" Ben said.', '""That\'s right. She\'d use it to write down all her thoughts and feelings when she was happy or sad. I brought you a notebook, too, just like the one she used. You can draw pictures or write down your feelings whenever you want.""', 'Ben opened the notebook and ran his fingers along the crisp white pages. He pictured his mother at her small writing desk in front of the window. He remembered how the sunlight would make her hair shine. She was so pretty. He closed his hand tightly around the pen. Ben thanked his father and clutched him hard around the middle.', '""Why can\'t she come back?"" Ben asked as he buried his face into his father\'s chest.', '""I wish she could, Ben. But that\'s not the way life works. Sometimes we don\'t have as much time as we\'d like with the people we love,"" he said as he hugged Ben tighter.', 'Ben was quiet, not knowing what to say.', 'After a moment, his father said, ""I\'m going to start dinner. Want to help?""', 'Ben shook his head, and his father slowly got to his feet. ""I\'m making mac and cheese — your favorite.""', '""Thanks, Dad."" Ben said. He looked at the notebook, wondering what to write.', '* * *', 'A little', ""while later, Emily gently knocked on the door to her brother's room. When she opened it a crack, she could see him curled up on his bed clutching his blanket and looking at the notebook. He had been crying."", '""What do you want?"" he sniffled.', '""I\'m sorry, Ben,"" Emily said as she sat on the bed next to her brother. ""I feel so angry at times, but I\'m not mad at you. I\'m sorry I took it out on you today.""', 'Ben sat up and wiped his nose on his sleeve. ""You\'re not the only one, Emily!""', ""Emily rested her hand on her brother's shoulder and tried to comfort him."", '""I think about Mom all the time,"" he said. ""I want her to come back.""', '""Me too, Ben, but, it\'s just you and me and Dad from now on. We\'ll be okay — you\'ll see."" Emily tried to sound convincing for Ben\'s sake, but she wasn\'t sure she really believed it.', '""Want to play the game I got for my birthday?"" she asked. ""You beat me the last time, and I want a rematch.""', '""Okay,"" he said. ""But only if I get to be the blue guy this time.""', '""Only if you get there first!"" she shouted as she started toward the door. She paused for a moment, giving him a chance to leap from the bed and out the door ahead of her.', '* * *', 'Later', ""in her room, Emily sat on her bed and listened to the heavy spring rain pouring down. She thought about her mother as she looked at the small wooden box beside her. She remembered the times they'd played with the shiny necklaces and sparkling earrings tucked away in the tiny drawers of her mother's jewelry box. Emily picked up one simple strand of pearly white beads. On special occasions, her mother would let her wear this necklace. Although it was not made of real pearls, it was special because it had been hand beaded by her mother. Emily had felt such pride when wearing her mother's favorite necklace. Now when she looked at it, she only wanted to cry. She carefully put the necklace away in the top drawer of the jewelry box. She was wiping the tears from her eyes when she heard a knock at the door."", '""Come in,"" she said softly.', 'As he entered her room, her father could see her red eyes and tear-stained cheeks. ""You okay, Em? Do you want to talk?"" he asked.', 'Emily nodded. ""I miss her so much.""', 'He sat down on the bed and gave her a tender, bittersweet smile. ""I know you do, sweetie. I really miss Mom, too.""', '""I can\'t believe she\'s really gone. How can we live without her, Dad?"" Emily cried.', '""One day at a time, Emily. I know it\'s hard to believe that it\'s possible to live without Mom. You and Ben might feel lost right now. Sometimes I feel that way, too — like I\'m out in the ocean, barely managing to keep my head above the water and trying to find steady ground. But sweetheart, it\'s within our reach. It may take some time, but we\'ll get there. And as long as we\'ve got each other — you, me, and Ben — we\'re not alone. And remember, Mom will always be with us.""', '""I don\'t understand,"" Emily said through her tears.', '""Mom will always be with you — in your heart, your mind, and your spirit. She\'s a part of you, and nothing can ever change that. You carry her with you wherever you go. Mom loved you so very much. Her love will stay with you always.""', 'Emily looked at her father, and he saw the pain and sadness in her wide round eyes. ""Will I always feel this way? Will it always hurt so much?""', 'He paused and said, ""I know you\'re hurting; I\'m hurting, too. I know it might be hard to understand this right now, Emily, but it will get easier over time. We\'ll always miss Mom, and some days you will feel more sad than others. Your grief will come and go, but you won\'t always feel this way.""', ""Emily had a hard time believing that the pain inside her would ever go away. How could it if her mother was never coming back? She looked out the window. Who would take care of her mother's garden now that she was gone? How would the plants survive if her mother wasn't there to take care of them? How would she?"", '* * *', 'One night', "", Ben couldn't sleep and wandered downstairs. He found his father sitting alone in the living room holding a golden picture frame. There were tears in his eyes."", 'Seeing Ben, his father put the picture down on the table beside the couch. ""Can\'t sleep, buddy?"" he asked.', 'Ben climbed up on the couch beside his father and shook his head.', '""Are you okay, Dad?"" Ben asked.', '""I\'m just sad. Everything reminds me of Mom,"" his father said as he looked at her picture on the table.', '""You can borrow Mom\'s pen anytime you want,"" Ben said as he looked up at his father. ""It makes me feel better when I use it.""', 'His father smiled tenderly and pulled Ben closer to him. ""Thanks, bud.""', '""Will you sing to me?"" Ben asked. ""The way she did?""', 'They snuggled up together on the couch.

Billy Majesty returned from the war with wounds related to being both shot and exposed to mustard gas. As a result, he cannot walk or work and has become addicted to morphine. Daisy, his wife, supports the family working as a spiritualist. Billy doesn’t approve, but Daisy and the Gumm family are much more pragmatic. In this adventure, Daisy is asked to teach a cooking class for disadvantaged immigrant ladies at the Salvation Army. That sounds innocent enough, but Daisy can’t cook. She manages to stay one step ahead of the class, but she lands right in the middle of an anarchist plot, forcing her to turn sleuth and, along the way, confront her prejudices against Germans, whom she blames for her husband’s disability.

Terrible Power of a Minor Guilt: Literary Essays;"['From Library Journal', 'Yehoshua, one of Israel\'s major novelists (Five Seasons; Mr. Mani), believes that the moral component of literature demands more attention in the current literary climate. Yehoshua writes that in this time of cultural relativism, literature has the power to show moral development and character change. This leads to the growth of the reader\'s self-knowledge, which Yehoshua maintains is sometimes available only through literary art. The complex social situations of marriage and guilt are discussed by using the works of Euripedes, Joseph Brenner (""The Way Out,"" ""Nerves""), Fyodor Dostoevsky (""The Eternal Husband""), William Faulkner, and Shmuel Yosef Agnon (""In the Prime of Life""). Other artists discussed are the authors of the Old Testament (Adam and Eve), Albert Camus, and Raymond Carver. Murder, the absurd, and unconscious desire are other moral questions he raises.

Bitter Seeds;['From Publishers Weekly', 'Debut novelist Tregillis breathes new life into alternate military history with this fun take on WWII. In this version of 1939 Germany, the insane Dr. von Westarp has given WWI orphans superpowers, such as fire-starting, intangibility, and invisibility.

Meanwhile, British secret agent Raybould Marsh recruits his old college buddy, magic-wielding aristocrat Will Beauclerk, to the British cause.

Fort Campbell was not a pleasant place in the wintertime. At least Fort Carson in Colorado had mountains right out the back door. Chief Warrant Officer 3 Randall Wurst clapped his hands to warm them, which was impossible because the doors of the vehicle bay stood wide open to the frigid gusts. Raised in the west, Randy would never get used to the dampness of the eastern United States. The rest of the company and battalion officers were in their offices packing up maps and personal equipment. Randy should have been inside with them, but he wanted to see how the rear gun mounts had turned out. He and the sergeants had spent hours tinkering to come up with the best way to rig an M240 machine gun on the back of a Humvee. In Afghanistan they had built a prototype, and an outfit down the road in Nashville was now turning out custom mounts to rig guns on every position of their trucks. The Taliban had called them ""the boxes with thorns."" The Afghans had learned to fear the ""bearded ones"" who drove the boxes and fought with such tenacity and ferocity.', ""One of the privileges of the Special Forces was the freedom to modify the army's standard-issue equipment or buy off-the-shelf products that would help get the job done. They were always seeking to improve their basic kit, whether gloves or guns or sights or vehicles. Randy gave thanks every time he saw a pair of German-made Hanwag boots. Perhaps their best find ever, those boots had carried him through long days of trekking in Afghanistan. Their rough-cut leather uppers had molded instantly to his feet with no painful breaking-in period and, best of all, their rubber soles had stuck like glue to the sheer mountains and screestrewn crevasses of Tora Bora where the Special Forces had searched for the caves of Al Qaeda and its leader, Osama bin Laden."", ""Randy climbed into the rear bed of the nearest Humvee and sat down on the bench by the M240 to check out the handiwork. The official army mount had been by the passenger side door, which limited the field of fire. So the team had soldered a new mount and put it on the rear corner. They had stripped the Humvees' rear gates and mounted racks for additional fuel and water cans. The M240 was the critical backup weapon for disengaging from a larger force or a tank. When the big .50-caliber gun in the turret (the one Randy manned) stopped to change ammunition cans, this one kept firing. Randy swung the gun toward him, crouching over it to aim in the same movement, swiveled with it in an arc, then snaked it back. It was much better, but it wasn't perfect-the mount could still stick in the stowed position. On the battlefield, that could make you a dead man. The square can that fed the belt of 7.62-mm rounds into the gun had to be placed at just the right angle or it would not feed properly. They would keep tinkering over in the desert. Humans are more important than hardware, as the special operations saying goes, but the humans need their hardware to fight."", 'Special Forces teams were heavily armed for their small size: they had either a .50-caliber gun or an Mk 19 grenade launcher in the Humvee turret and an M240 machine gun on the back. They had AT-4 anti-tank weapons strapped to the roof edges, and each man had his M4 rifle, 9-mm pistol, and grenades. At least one team member also had an M203 grenade launcher attached under the barrel of his M4. This was a formidable amount of weaponry for twelve men.', 'The ritual of preparing for war was a familiar one for Randy, but this time it had a special poignance. This was likely to be the last war he would fight, at least on the frontlines, and he was having a hard time assimilating that fact.', 'Being a Special Forces soldier was the pinnacle of his life, and it seemed that everything had led him inexorably down this path. The blood of warriors ran in his veins. His grandfather was a Blackfoot, born on a reservation, who had founded an outfitting business in . Randy grew up on a ranch, learning to ride his buckskin pony, Sugarfoot, at the age of three. He became a cowboy, adept at riding and breaking horses, and learned the arts of survival from his family of ranchers, trappers, hunters, and outfitters. His nickname, ""Rawhide,"" would later become his call sign. When he left home, his beloved grandfather gave him his medicine bag containing the talismans of long-ago battles and places sacred to his people.', ""After some detours Randy joined the military, following his father and brother who had served in wartime. For him it became a career when he earned a coveted place in the Special Forces. Twenty years and five wars later, he knew that he would have to hang up his soldier's spurs soon."", 'Many of the senior Special Forces soldiers who would play a pivotal role in the war in Iraq had begun their SF careers in Desert Storm or a couple of years earlier in Just Cause in Panama-the first time Special Forces had seen combat since Vietnam, officially anyway. The soldiers now formed a seasoned group whose members had worn their green berets through numerous wars, backwater conflicts, and secret operations. They were not only the backbone and institutional memory of the Special Forces but often were the most experienced of any soldiers on the frontlines.', ""Randy had lost track of how many countries he'd been deployed to and how many Christmases and birthdays he'd spent away from home, but he did not lose count of the comrades he had lost over those years-their names and faces were etched in his heart. Some of them were remembered in a small grove of trees planted on the east side of their grassy parade ground at Fort Campbell. A plaque listed each man's name and unit."", 'The earth was still fresh around trees that had been planted for the men who had died in Afghanistan, the largest group of casualties since an entire team crashed in a Black Hawk helicopter during a training exercise in Yuma, Arizona, in 1989. There was a tree for J.D. Davis and those who had died with him. There was one for Nathan Chapman, who had pulled every string to get transferred from Asia to the fight in Afghanistan; Stanley Harriman, a chief warrant officer like himself, who had died trying to save his men; and, in the corner, Bobby Deeks, killed in Somalia in 1993. Randy said a quick prayer for them all as the sun lowered through the leafless branches of the slender trees, and then walked quickly from the bay toward the dun-colored three-story barracks.', ""He bounded up the cement steps and yanked hard on the barracks' door. Built in 1952, the buildings were as old as the Special Forces. The door vents were rusted through, the cinderblock was crumbling, hinges were rusted, and insulation hung out of the ceilings. The Special Forces' low-rise complex, clustered around the parade ground just off Bastogne Avenue, was the oldest on the entire base. One ground-floor office had a finger-sized crack that went through to the outside. The Special Forces were proud of their make-do philosophy, but they carped just the same about being the unloved stepchild at Fort Campbell, which was wholly and completely dominated by the Screaming Eagles of the 101st Airborne Division. The largest tenant unit of any army base always ruled the roost, and the famous 101st did so with particular zeal. Additionally, its commanders did not like the fact that some of their best and brightest noncommissioned officers tried out for the Special Forces, attracted by the idea of roaming the world in twelve-man teams on secret missions. Special Forces had to become high-altitude parachutists, so soldiers with wings, like those in the 101st, had an advantage."", ""Cruising down the hallway, Randy saw Master Sergeant Alan Johnson disappear into the company commander's office. Alan was like a brother to him, but these days he also was a reminder of loss. Randy had left the twelve-man team that they together had led through Kosovo and Afghanistan, and Alan knew that Randy was bereft. Randy had served for fourteen years on Operational Detachments Alpha (ODAs), as the twelve-man teams are officially called. That was about as long as anyone had managed to stay in the ground-level units. He had been kicked upstairs to the company staff."", ""Alan was one of the most popular team sergeants around. He was a force of nature, as audacious and intelligent an operator as ever produced, with an irrepressible sense of humor. A handsome light-skinned African American, he had a thousand-megawatt smile and a deep rumbling laugh. Men loved serving with him. Randy and he had been on the same team, 563, for three years. They greeted their company commander, Jonathan Burns, a major who had just transferred that summer from Fort Bragg. He had the pale skin and red-brown hair of the Irish, a group well represented in Special Forces' ranks, and a subversive wit. He'd stenciled his call sign, Wildman, on the back of his armored Humvee. Alan went off to discuss his mission with the battalion commander, and Randy sat down to review his duties with Burns. Randy feared that he would not even get close to the frontlines now that his job was to oversee intelligence and operations for the whole company, but he vowed not to complain. He suspected Burns was a frustrated gunslinger too-it came with the seniority."", 'Alan headed to the end of the second building on the southern flank of the complex to see the battalion commander. The unlucky bachelors slept on the third floor of the dilapidated barracks. He was spared that fate. He had a wife, and if all went well, they would have a baby soon. He knocked on the open door and Lt. Col. Conner\'s aide waved him in. Conner was bent over a canvas duel spread out on the floor, on top of a small Afghan carpet and a rug embroidered with the Special Forces\' crossed-arrow insignia and motto ""De Oppresso Liber"" (to free the oppressed).', '""Have a seat, Al,"" Conner said. ""Let\'s talk while I get this last stuff stowed.""', ""Alan squeezed his frame onto the small couch. Special Forces soldiers tended to fall into one of two categories: the big and burly or the compact and wiry. The big ones had to have the stamina to make it through the Special Forces' selection process. Willpower, not size, was the common denominator. Alan was a big man, pounds of solid muscle, but his geniality tended to soften his size into a less intimidating package, until he put on his game face."", ""Lieutenant Colonel Chris Conner was also a big fellow, six feet two and pounds, but his temperament was so placid that his size did not dominate the conversation. Conner had assumed command of the battalion over the summer, though he was no stranger to Fort Campbell. He had spent his early Special Forces career here and had returned from serving in Washington on the Joint Staff, where one of his colleagues called him the finest action officer he'd ever seen. It was a happy homecoming for a low-key, well-liked officer. He knew many of the older sergeants from his previous posting here, and he had known Randy from his first days in the Special Forces tryout. The sergeants tend to stay put in the same battalion, or at least the same group, for the bulk of their careers, which makes them the institutional memory of the organization. This is important for any organization, but it is especially valuable given the mandate of the Special Forces."", 'Each Special Forces group is organized into three battalions: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. Each battalion has three companies, called Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie. Each company, in turn, is composed of six teams, the twelveman Operational Detachments Alpha which are known by number. The group, battalion, and company echelons all have headquarters and support staffs. Some groups only field five teams per company because there are not enough Special Forces to fill all the authorized slots. The deep cuts in army personnel in the mid-1990s made it even more difficult to find qualified personnel.', 'Alan had gone to talk to Colonel Conner because the battalion commander was intimately familiar with the area in Iraq to which his team had been assigned. To prepare for their mission, Alan and his team had read the after-action reports of the earlier war. ""Hey, the old man was here!"" one of them exclaimed upon seeing that the report was signed by (then Captain) Chris Conner. Conner had been on a secret reconnaissance mission in exactly the same spot twelve years before, in Operation Desert Storm, when a handful of U.S. and British special operations forces were inserted clandestinely deep within Iraqi territory.', 'The team plied the ""old man"" with questions as they planned their operation. Not many Americans had set foot in Iraq, and nothing could prepare them better than the firsthand ""ground truth"" of one who had. Conner and his team had learned that lesson the hard way.', ""Conner and his fellow commanders had carefully chosen which teams would be assigned to which missions in Iraq. Many of his senior sergeants were veterans of Desert Storm. One of them, Master Sergeant Steve Rainey, had helped train and fight with the Saudis, working side by side with Conner's team until Conner was tapped for the reconnaissance mission. Rainey was a perfectionist, cynical and hard-bitten. He drove his men hard but drove himself harder. Few could outshoot him, even though he had a few fingers missing on his right hand. The Saudi army had not been much of a fighting machine, but in a few short weeks Rainey's team had managed to drill soldier skills into it."", 'Rainey had since become the team sergeant of ODA 544; he and two other senior NCOs brought more than a half-century of Special Forces\' experience to their team. That experience was the real secret of the Army Special Forces. No other ground-level unit anywhere in the U.S. military could claim such a store of military knowledge and capability. The captains, who command the teams, come straight from the schoolhouse to an eighteen-month stint in charge of the twelve-man operational detachments. After that, the captains move to higher echelons while the ten sergeants and the chief warrant officers continue to serve on teams for years. Colonel Conner knew what he was doing when he and the company commander, Major Andy Lohman, decided to make ODA 544 the ""pilot team"" that would enter the critical southern city of Najaf first.', 'The Special Forces are not a rapid deployment force; the secret of their success is intensive preparation.

If this involves fewer imports and consequent repercussions on exports then it is industry that must be readjusted to the needs of food. If such readjustment involves the decentralisation of industry and the re-opening of local mills and slaughter-houses, then the health of the nation is more important than any large combine.', 'Lady Eve Balfour, founder of the Soil Association, 1943', 'Given the degree to which the modern food system has become dependent on fossil fuels, many proposals for de-linking food and fossil fuels are likely to appear radical. However, efforts toward this end must be judged not by the degree to which they preserve the status quo, but by their likely ability to solve the fundamental challenge that will face us: the need to feed a global population of seven billion with a diminishing supply of fuels available to fertilise, plough, and irrigate fields and to harvest and transport crops.', 'Richard Heinberg and Michael Bomford, 2009', ""Food shapes and is shaped by many areas of our lives, from how we organise our days to the topography of our land, and much in between – our physical and emotional health; the climate; the quality of our air, water and soil; the diversity of the wildlife; the structure of our economies and the closeness of our communities. So it is perhaps not surprising that as change to the globalised, industrial food system is made inevitable by the limits of its own excesses (as discussed in the Introduction), one of the most popular focuses and starting points for many community-strengthening projects is the transformation and redefinition of the community's relationship to food – how it chooses to sow, grow, fertilise, harvest, sell, transport, source, buy, cook or eat it. In so doing, this process is helping to reinvigorate the local food networks, or 'foodsheds' that once provided all of our food – webs of small-scale, commercial, non-profit-making and home-based producers, growers, processors and consumers, who are linked by face-to-face relationships and who share a local economy, environment and community."", 'The shift towards local food is by no means happening only among the usual green suspects and the ranks of resource depletionists – it is also gathering momentum within the mainstream.

Adoption-Specific Therapy: A Guide to Helping Adopted Children and Their Families Thrive;"['Review', 'This essential resource for clinicians, written by a team with a broad and deep understanding of adoption, provides hands-on, practical guidelines for conducting therapy with adopted children and their families. Both developmentally and culturally sensitive, their approach draws from the best available research about the unique needs of adopted children. Case examples bring the application of the approach to life and provide useful insights for adoptive parents, who will find reassurance that they are not alone. Any therapist wishing to be viewed as ""adoption-competent"" needs this book.', '-- Harold D. Grotevant, PhD, Rudd Family Foundation Chair in Psychology, University of Massachusetts Amherst', 'About the Author', 'Jill Waterman, PhD,', 'is adjunct professor emerita in the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) psychology department and for many years was coordinator of the UCLA Psychology Clinic, the training clinic for UCLA’s top-ranked clinical psychology doctoral program. She was one of the initial developers of UCLA Training, Intervention, Education, and Services (TIES) for Adoption (now called UCLA TIES for Families), an interdisciplinary program to support successful adoption from foster care of children with prenatal substance exposure and other at-risk conditions, and she has been with TIES since its inception in 1995. Much of the content of the adoption-specific therapy (ADAPT) model was developed through her years of clinical work and supervision at TIES. Currently, Dr. Waterman is the director of Infant Mental Health at UCLA TIES for Families, where she oversees the clinical and research components of the program. Dr. Waterman’s research involves various aspects of adoption and child trauma. She and her students have followed one cohort of children adopted from foster care for 15–20 years and are now following a cohort of infants with prenatal substance exposure who are in foster care with prospective adoptive parents. In addition, she has provided training and consultation both locally and nationally on issues related to parenting and treatment of children in or adopted from foster care. Dr. Waterman has cochaired 21 doctoral dissertations and is the author of two books on child sexual abuse as well as an evidence-based group treatment manual for at-risk middle school students.', 'Audra K. Langley, PhD,', 'is a clinical child psychologist and associate professor at the UCLA Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior and the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine Department of Pediatrics. She is the director of UCLA TIES for Families, an innovative multidisciplinary program for children in or adopted from foster care and their families in Los Angeles County. Dr. Langley specializes in evidence-based treatments for children and adolescents with posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and related issues. Her body of work has sought to increase access to quality mental health interventions for underserved populations of children, including those in schools and involved with the child welfare system. Dr. Langley has been the director of training for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration–funded Trauma Services Center for Resiliency, Hope, and Wellness in Schools since 2003 and served for 7 years as chair of the Schools Committee for the National Child Traumatic Stress Network. Nationally and locally, she provides training and consultation related to trauma-informed, child-welfare competent care to professionals in multiple fields and to parents and caregivers. Dr. Langley recently developed and evaluated Bounce Back, an intervention for ethnically and socioeconomically diverse elementary-aged children exposed to traumatic events, which has since been disseminated nationally. She is the author of four treatment manuals and a proud parent of biological and adopted children.', 'Jeanne Miranda, PhD,', 'is a professor in the department of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at UCLA. Her major research contributions have been in evaluating mental health care for poor and minority women. She is evaluating an intervention her team developed for families adopting older children from foster care, adapting depression interventions for young women in Uganda, as well as evaluating governmental social programs there. She has developed and is evaluating a resilience intervention for low-income and minority lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender populations. She was the senior scientific editor of Mental Health: Culture, Race and Ethnicity: A Report of the Surgeon General. She became a member of the Institute of Medicine, now the National Academy of Medicine, in 2005.

Riley, LCMFT,', 'is a licensed clinical marriage and family therapist and CEO and cofounder of the Center for Adoption Support and Education (C.A.S.E.), an independent, nonprofit adoptive family support center in the Baltimore–Washington area. A nationally recognized adoption expert and dynamic public speaker, Ms. Riley has 35 years of professional experience, including extensive health care management, administrative expertise, designing and developing nationally acclaimed adoption competent programs, and direct delivery of specialized counseling services, which affords her the broad knowledge and nationally respected expertise needed to promote mental health training, child advocacy, and public policy development. Ms. Riley created a continuum of innovative, culturally responsive, evidenced-informed programs to improve the behavioral outcomes of foster and adopted youth and their families, which has become a nationally recognized model. Ms. Riley consults with national child welfare agencies on complex child welfare issues and systems of care enhancement. For over a decade, she has built and implemented a framework for training an adoption-competent mental health workforce nationally and is the founder of the Training for Adoption Competency curriculum currently taught in 17 states. Through a recent federal 5-year grant awarded to C.A.S.E. from the U.S. Department of Health\xa0 and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Ms. Riley serves as the principal investigator to establish a National Adoption Competency Mental Health Training Initiative (NTI). The initiative will build the adoption competency capacity of child welfare professionals and mental health practitioners who serve youth moving toward permanency as well as youth living in permanent adoptive or guardianship homes. The NTI will develop state-of-the-art, evidence-informed adoption competency web-based curricula for each group, with quality improvement components for use on a national basis.

DAH Theatre: A Sourcebook;"['Review', 'This is an excellent, easy to comprehend book that fills a gap in studies on resistance performance groups dedicated to “alternatives to the dominant narrative of denial” and is an invaluable sourcebook for those who choose to investigate how theatre as “a space for collective mourning” has been and can be staged. As such, it is a valuable contribution to the recently enfranchised discipline concerned with creative transformation of conflict.... [I]t is a pioneer in books on theatre that are written with the conviction that “theatre can change the world”. ―', 'Plays International & Europe', ""This international collection of theoretically and historically grounded analyses and illuminating testimonials by scholars and practitioners comprises the impressive dramaturgical archive of one of the most enduring (East) European alternative theatres today. For more than twenty-five years, the Belgrade-based DAH Theatre has resonated with Eastern as well as Western audiences by highlighting 'postcolonial' conditions fiercely agitated in some post-totalitarian countries, yet obscured in egalitarian societies, such as ethnic and gender inequities, (multi)cultural expressions, and reconciliation with traumatic and divisive histories. DAH's journey outlines a global artistic trade that begins with adopting postmodern practices originating in the West, in particular Eugenio Barba's 'theatre anthropology', creatively advancing them in the volatile post-communist context of former Yugoslavia, and exporting them internationally as a model of new performance aesthetics and socially engaged theatre. -- Vessela Warner, University of Alabama at BirminghamDennis Barnett has assembled a most informed and engaging sourcebook on DAH Theatre, one of the world’s definitive companies working in social conflict contexts. A work of great breadth that offers a meaningful and enjoying read to the historian, the scholar and the practitioner, while ultimately managing to paint the rich portrait of a living theater and of the people and societal circumstances that breathe life into it.

His political career began with moving from a Harvard teaching fellowship to Boston City Hall politics in reform mayor Kevin white\'s administration and eventually to election to Congress in 1980, where he rose to current chairmanship of the House Financial Services Committee. among the many compelling passages here are those detailing Frank\'s half-in, half-out of the closet life while in his forties―an unfortunate but understandable \'midlife adolescence\' for a man who had previously paid male prostitutes and \'didn\'t have a social life until he was 45.\' A significant additional to political and gay studies.""―', 'Booklist', 'About the Author', 'Stuart Weisberg is an attorney who spent ten years as staff director and chief counsel for the House Government Operations Subcommittee on Employment and Housing.

While undergoing chemotherapy, the time Jeff spent with Freedom soothed his spirit and gave him the strength to fight. When he learned he was cancer free, he shared his news on a walk with Freedom.

Operation Just Cause: The Storming of Panama;"['From Publishers Weekly', ""Drawing on hundreds of interviews, the authors describe the invasion of 26,000 U.S. troops against the Panama Defense Forces, and the toppling of Manuel Noriega. In addition to crisp accounts of conventional firefights during the brief campaign--December '89-January '90--the book describes a wide variety of military situations, affording readers a close look at how U.S. troops make war in the post-Vietnam era: Capt. Linda Bray becomes the first female to lead American troops into battle; an American civilian is rescued from the Model Prison by Delta Force commandos; U.S. and Panamanian forces fight hand-to-hand in an airport women's restroom. As the authors make clear, Operation Just Cause marked a significant change from Washington's concentration on the Soviet menace. With the protection of American citizens abroad becoming increasingly important in the face of terrorism and hostage-taking, we can expect the smaller U.S. Army to be oriented toward a different variety of threats, note the authors. The book offers a sharp examination of how the Army went into action on a new kind of front. Donnelly and Roth report for Army Times , Baker for Defense News. Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc."", 'From Kirkus Reviews', ""Three editors of Army Times offer a minutely detailed--and adulatory--narrative of Operation Just Cause, the US invasion of Panama in December 1989. Despite Gen. Noriega's intelligence services to the US about Cuba and the Marxist forces in Central America, the authors say, it was clear to the White House that the Panamanian strongman had to be deposed. According to Donnelly, Roth, and Baker, Noriega and his henchmen had stolen elections, looted the Treasury of Panama, murdered, kidnapped, beat, and tortured rivals, built a ruthless military force, dealt in lucrative drug trafficking, detained and beat Americans, and, finally, killed a US marine officer. The general had also worked with Cuba against US interests, endangering Canal security and American citizens. Finally, President Bush, his patience exhausted, gave go-ahead orders to the planners of Operation Just Cause, Generals Powell and Thurmon, who, the authors note, had learned in Vietnam the high price of the piecemeal application of deadly force--a price not paid again in Panama as, under the unified command of General Carl Stiner, elite American units from all service branches swept away the well-armed forces of Noriega in eight hours. The authors see the kind of small, splendidly trained and equipped all-volunteer army that defeated Noriega as well suited for the role of possibly stabilizing other countries in order to buy time to allow democratic societies and free economies to develop. Starting with Carter, they argue, American policy has begun to promote democracy and human rights in Latin America, replacing the old image of ``Yankee imperialism.'' Recent revelations about the high number of Panamanian casualties during the invasion leave some doubt as to exactly how efficient American forces were. Still, an unusually upbeat military history of the war that served as a training ground for Operation Desert Storm. --"", 'Copyright ©1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

American Medical Association Family Medical Guide, 4th Edition;"['From Publishers Weekly', 'Medical ""bibles"" go out of date quickly. Diseases don\'t change, but our understanding of them does. So a new volume of a standard guide for the nonphysician is certainly welcome. What\'s perhaps most gratifying about this updated reference is that, based on new understanding of how much regular people can do to keep body and mind whole, it advises readers to take an active approach. For those already suffering a particular medical condition—and the book covers a great deal of territory, from blood to heart to brain diseases—this volume will serve as a source of real understanding. Armed with the basics, patients may be less embarrassed to ask more of their physicians or surgeons. The authors acknowledge the benefits of yoga and meditation (which they call the relaxation response) and offer a rundown of homeopathic medicine. Other new additions include expanded coverage of genetic testing, learning disabilities, ADD and stem cell transplants. The authors discuss sexually transmitted diseases, sexual orientation, contraception and abortion with forthrightness. Self-help charts that will supposedly lead readers from symptom to diagnosis are a kind of maze game and will keep hypochondriacs busy for hours. This is a well-organized volume, considering the amount of information it covers. By educating patients, the book may be as much a help to physicians as it is to their charges. Photos, illus.

Core Java, Vol. 2: Advanced Features, 8th Edition;"['About the Author', 'Cay S. Horstmann', 'is also coauthor of', 'Core JavaServer Faces, Second Edition', '(Prentice Hall, 2007). Cay is a professor of computer science at San Jose State University, a Java Champion, and a frequent speaker at computer industry conferences.', 'Gary Cornell', ""has been writing and teaching programming professionals for more than twenty years and is the cofounder of Apress. He has written numerous best-selling books for programming professionals, was a cofinalist for a Jolt Award, and won the Readers' Choice award from"", 'Visual Basic Magazine', '.', 'Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved.', 'To the Reader', 'The book you have in your hands is the second volume of the eighth edition of', 'Core Java', '™', ',', 'fully updated for Java SE 6. The first volume covers the essential features of the language; this volume covers the advanced topics that a programmer will need to know for professional software development. Thus, as with the first volume and the previous editions of this book, we are still targeting programmers who want to put Java technology to work on real projects.', 'Please note: If you are an experienced developer who is comfortable with advanced language features such as inner classes and generics, you need not have read the first volume in order to benefit from this volume. While we do refer to sections of the previous volume when appropriate (and, of course, hope you will buy or have bought Volume I), you can find the needed background material in any comprehensive introductory book about the Java platform.', 'Finally, when any book is being written, errors and inaccuracies are inevitable. We would very much like to hear about them should you find any in this book. Of course, we would prefer to hear about them only once. For this reason, we have put up a web site at http://horstmann.com/corejava with an FAQ, bug fixes, and workarounds. Strategically placed at the end of the bug report web page (to encourage you to read the previous reports) is a form that you can use to report bugs or problems and to send suggestions for improvements to future editions.', 'About This Book', 'The chapters in this book are, for the most part, independent of each other. You should be able to delve into whatever topic interests you the most and read the chapters in any order.', 'The topic of', 'Chapter 1', 'is input and output handling. In Java, all I/O is handled through so-called', 'streams', '. Streams let you deal, in a uniform manner, with communications among various sources of data, such as files, network connections, or memory blocks. We include detailed coverage of the reader and writer classes, which make it easy to deal with Unicode. We show you what goes on under the hood when you use the object serialization mechanism, which makes saving and loading objects easy and convenient. Finally, we cover the “new I/O” classes (which were new when they were added to Java SE 1.4) that support efficient file operations, and the regular expression library.', 'Chapter 2', 'covers XML. We show you how to parse XML files, how to generate XML, and how to use XSL transformations. As a useful example, we show you how to specify the layout of a Swing form in XML. This chapter has been updated to include the XPath API, which makes “finding needles in XML haystacks” much easier.', 'Chapter 3', 'covers the networking API. Java makes it phenomenally easy to do complex network programming. We show you how to make network connections to servers, how to implement your own servers, and how to make HTTP connections.', 'Chapter 4', 'covers database programming. The main focus is on JDBC, the Java database connectivity API that lets Java programs connect to relational databases. We show you how to write useful programs to handle realistic database chores, using a core subset of the JDBC API. (A complete treatment of the JDBC API would require a book almost as long as this one.) We finish the chapter with a brief introduction into hierarchical databases and discuss JNDI (the Java Naming and Directory Interface) and LDAP (the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).', 'Chapter 5', 'discusses a feature that we believe can only grow in importance—internationalization. The Java programming language is one of the few languages designed from the start to handle Unicode, but the internationalization support in the Java platform goes much further. As a result, you can internationalize Java applications so that they not only cross platforms but cross country boundaries as well. For example, we show you how to write a retirement calculator applet that uses either English, German, or Chinese languages—depending on the locale of the browser.', 'Chapter 6', 'contains all the Swing material that didn’t make it into Volume I, especially the important but complex tree and table components. We show the basic uses of editor panes, the Java implementation of a “multiple document” interface, progress indicators that you use in multithreaded programs, and “desktop integration features” such as splash screens and support for the system tray. Again, we focus on the most useful constructs that you are likely to encounter in practical programming because an encyclopedic coverage of the entire Swing library would fill several volumes and would only be of interest to dedicated taxonomists.', 'Chapter 7', 'covers the Java 2D API, which you can use to create realistic drawings and special effects. The chapter also covers some advanced features of the AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) that seemed too specialized for coverage in Volume I but are, nonetheless, techniques that should be part of every programmer’s toolkit. These features include printing and the APIs for cut-and-paste and drag-and-drop.', 'Chapter 8', 'shows you what you need to know about the component API for the Java platform—JavaBeans. We show you how to write your own beans that other programmers can manipulate in integrated builder environments. We conclude this chapter by showing you how you can use JavaBeans persistence to store your own data in a format that—unlike object serialization—is suitable for long-term storage.', 'Chapter 9', 'takes up the Java security model. The Java platform was designed from the ground up to be secure, and this chapter takes you under the hood to see how this design is implemented. We show you how to write your own class loaders and security managers for special-purpose applications. Then, we take up the security API that allows for such important features as message and code signing, authorization and authentication, and encryption. We conclude with examples that use the AES and RSA encryption algorithms.', 'Chapter 10', 'covers distributed objects. We cover RMI (Remote Method Invocation) in detail. This API lets you work with Java objects that are distributed over multiple machines. We then briefly discuss web services and show you an example in which a Java program communicates with the Amazon Web Service.', 'Chapter 11', 'discusses three techniques for processing code. The scripting and compiler APIs, introduced in Java SE 6, allow your program to call code in scripting languages such as JavaScript or Groovy, and to compile Java code. Annotations allow you to add arbitrary information (sometimes called metadata) to a Java program. We show you how annotation processors can harvest these annotations at the source or class file level, and how annotations can be used to influence the behavior of classes at runtime. Annotations are only useful with tools, and we hope that our discussion will help you select useful annotation processing tools for your needs.', 'Chapter 12', 'takes up native methods, which let you call methods written for a specific machine such as the Microsoft Windows API. Obviously, this feature is controversial: Use native methods, and the cross-platform nature of the Java platform vanishes. Nonetheless, every serious programmer writing Java applications for specific platforms needs to know these techniques. At times, you need to turn to the operating system’s API for your target platform when you interact with a device or service that is not supported by the Java platform. We illustrate this by showing you how to access the registry API in Windows from a Java program.', 'As always, all chapters have been completely revised for the latest version of Java.

On its shore were a half dozen cottages that had no names and one stately house that did. It was called the Stone House, and a little girl named Martha Morse lived there with her family many, many years ago.', 'The name of the valley was Glencaraid. That meant ""Friendly Valley,"" and Loch Caraid meant ""Friendly Lake."" The people who lived in the valley had a story about those names. One summer evening, when it was just cool enough for a fire made of peat grass to flicker on the hearth, Martha heard the story from her mother.', ""Martha's three brothers and her one sister were downstairs in the kitchen begging plums from the cook. Her father was busy at his writing table. Father was laird of the estate of Glencaraid, and he had important letters to write. So just for now, Martha had Mum all to herself in the cozy corner beside the hearth of Mum and Father's big bedroom. The scratching of Father's feather pen was a pleasant accompaniment to Mum's story and the soft whirring of her spinning wheel."", '""It was many hundreds of years ago,"" Mum was saying, ""that a man named Edward MacNab caught his first glimpse of the loch from high above on the mountainside.""', '""MacNab!"" Martha said. ""But we\'re MacNabs!""', '""Aye."" Mum nodded. ""That we are. You have MacNab blood on both sides, for your father\'s grandfather married a MacNab girl, and my own mother was of that clan. Although your name be Morse, my lass, you\'re more MacNab than aught else.""', '""Is your mother in the story?"" Martha wanted to know.', 'Mum laughed. ""Och, nay! This happened long years before my mother was even dreamed of, or her mother, or', 'her', 'mother. Now--shall I go on?""', '""Aye!"" Martha nodded, her long red curls bouncing on her shoulders. She scooted her stool closer to Mum so that she could hear better above the spinning wheel\'s hum. Beneath Mum\'s fingers golden-brown flax fibers twisted into one long, spider-thin thread. The peat fire glowed and crackled. Even though it was summer, the mountain wind carried a chill to the valley at night.', ""Mum's tale spun out above the thread. Edward MacNab, she told Martha, had been traveling for a very long time. He was bone-tired and hoped to see the smoke of a chimney in the valley below, for he had a longing to spend the night in a warm bed."", 'But the evening was misty and dim. All Edward could see of the valley was the dark water of the lake at the foot of the mountains. In the gloomy light it looked exactly like a mouth waiting to swallow anyone who dared climb down. Not far from the lake were two little ponds that looked just like two angry, staring eyes. Edward MacNab shuddered and gave a low whistle.', '""\'Tis no a friendly sort of a place, that!"" he said. He spoke aloud, for he thought there was no one around to hear. But he was wrong. He was not alone.', ""A water fairy lived in the lake, and she had wandered onto the mountain that evening to gather mist from the rocky crags. When she saw Edward, she wrapped some shreds of mist around her so she wouldn't be seen. And she would have stayed hidden, if only he had spoken more wisely--or not at all."", '""But it is ever the gift and the curse of a MacNab to speak the thoughts that pop into his mind,"" Mum told Martha. ""Your father has it, and so do you, my bold wee lass. As soon as you could speak, you were saying things aloud that others would only dare to think. Never will I forget the first time you met auld Laird Alroch. Marched right up to him, you did, and asked if it was true he was bald as an egg under his wig!""', '""But what about the water fairy?"" Martha said impatiently. She had already heard the story of what she had once said to the kind old gentleman who lived on the other side of the mountains. Fairies were much more interesting.', '""Well,"" Mum went on, ""it did not sit well with the fairy to hear this stranger speaking of her loch in that way. She crept up to Edward and laid one pale hand on his shoulder. Quick as a wink she turned him to stone.', '""\'Not friendly, is it?\' she said to Edward--for though his body was frozen in rock, he had yet the senses of a man and could hear her. Edward stared at the water fairy with his stone eyes that could not blink.', '""Her skin was whiter than new-bleached linen. Her hair was the pale green of a spring leaf just opening on the twig, and it fell in ripples all the way to her feet. She had slanting green eyes and a little pointed chin. Edward MacNab thought he had never seen aught so lovely.""', ""Martha thought to herself that the fairy must have looked like Mum, except Mum's eyes were blue and her hair was a rich golden brown instead of pale green. She wore it piled high on her head in a mass of shining waves. Her blue eyes always had a laugh peeking out of them, even now when her brows were drawn together fiercely in imitation of the water fairy's anger."", 'Mum\'s lilting voice grew cold and furious as she spoke the fairy\'s words.

The iPhone Developer's Cookbook: Building Applications with the iPhone SDK;"['Review', 'About the Author', 'Erica Sadun', 'has written, coauthored, and contributed to about three dozen books about technology, particularly in the areas of programming, digital video, and digital photography. An unrepentant geek, Sadun has never met a gadget she didn\x92t need. Her checkered past includes run-ins with NeXT, Newton, iPhone, and myriad successful and unsuccessful technologies. When not writing, she and her geek husband parent three adorable geeks-in-training, who regard their parents with restrained bemusement.', 'Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved.', 'Preface', 'Preface', 'Few platforms match the iPhone’s unique developer technologies. It combines OS X-based mobile computing with an innovative multitouch screen, location awareness, an onboard accelerometer, and more. When Apple introduced the iPhone Cocoa Touch SDK beta in early March 2008, developers responded in numbers that brought Apple’s servers to its knees. Apple delivered more than one hundred thousand SDK downloads in less than one week. The iPhone Developer’s Cookbook was written to address this demand, providing an accessible resource for those new to iPhone programming.', 'Who This Book Is For', 'This book is written for new iPhone developers with projects to get done and a new unfamiliar SDK in their hands. Although each programmer brings different goals and experiences to the table, most developers end up solving similar tasks in their development work: “How do I build a table?”; “How do I create a secure keychain entry?”; “How do I search the Address Book?”; “How do I move between views?”; and “How do I use Core Location?”', 'The iPhone Developer’s Cookbook is aimed squarely at anyone just getting started with iPhone programming. With its clear, fully documented examples, it will get you up to speed and working productively. It presents already tested ready-to-use solutions, letting programmers focus on the specifics of their application rather than on boilerplate tasks.', 'How This Book Is Structured', 'This book offers single-task recipes for the most common issues new iPhone developers face: laying out interface elements, responding to users, accessing local data sources, and connecting to the Internet. The cookbook approach delivers cut-and-paste convenience. Programmers can add source recipes into their projects and then customize them to their needs. Each chapter groups related tasks together.

All rights reserved.', 'The Middle March, Scottish Borders—late summer 1528', ""Something was wrong. He could tell, even from this distance, though he could not explain how.John had not set eyes on his family's brooding stone tower in ten years. Not since he'd been sent to the court of the boy king. Now that king was grown and had sent him home with a duty to perform.One he meant to complete quickly, so he could leave this place and never return.A shaft of sunlight cast sharp-edged shadows across the summer-green grass. His horse shifted and so did the wind, bringing with it the sharp, painful wail of keening.That was what he had recognised. Death. Someone had died. Who?He gathered the reins and urged the horse ahead, thinking of the family he had left behind. Father, older brother, younger sister. His mother was dead these twelve months. They had sent him word of that, at least.His sister was the only one he cared to see again. No surety that they mourned a family member. Others were part of the tower's household. But he galloped across the valley as if the time of his arrival might matter.At the gate in the barmkin wall around the tower, he was challenged, as he had expected. The man was not one he recognised.Not one who would recognise him.He removed his polished helmet to show friendly features, glad of cool air on his face again. 'It's John Brunson."", 'Sir', ""John now, knighted by the king.' He had waited years and miles to say so. 'Tell Geordie the Red his youngest son is home.'"", ""Tell him I'll not be here long."", ""The man leaned back on his pike. 'There'll be no telling of anything to Red Geordie Brunson. He lies dead in his bed.'And John, silent, couldn't summon up even the pretence of sorrow.John or Sir John, there was no convincing the man to let him in. Despite the fact that people were gathering for the wake, they made him wait until they fetched his brother, Rob, to verify his identity. He could not blame them. That was the way of the Borders.In truth, he'd found little more trust in the men surrounding the king. They were just less obvious about their suspicions.Rob, bearded now and taller and broader than John remembered, stood on the wall walk, arms folded in doubt, letting John sweat beneath his full harness of armour. It was as much for his moods as his dark hair that they'd called him Black Rob. Now, new lines scored his brow and John wondered how many of them had deepened since he woke to find himself head man of the riding clan.'You claim to be my brother?' Even Rob could not recognise him with a glance. John had been twelve, only half-grown when he left.'Aye. You're looking at the son of Geordie the Red.''A Storwick could say the same.' His sceptical disdain was everything John had remembered. And hated. 'What brings you here?'He did not ask what brings you"", 'home,', ""as if he would not call Brunson Tower John's home, either.But everything was different now. Instead of begging Rob's permission and asking his help, now John would tell his brother what must be. 'I'm sent of King James, fifth of that name.'His brother snorted. 'That's no talisman of entry.'Ruled by his advisers for the last fifteen years, the young king's name struck no terror on the Borders. But John knew the king well enough to know that it would. And soon.'Look at my eyes and you'll know me.' Johnnie Blunkit they had called him. The only Brunson with blue eyes.'If you're a Brunson, then what's your father's father's father's father's name?'He searched his memory, blank, then tried to summon the ballad of the Brunsons. Only the opening lines sang in his head."", ""Silent as moonrise, sure as the stars, Strong as the wind that sweeps Carter's Bar."", ""There was little else he remembered of his people. And less that he wanted to.'I may not be able to name my great-great-grandfather, but I remember well enough, Black Rob, how you tried to teach me the sword. Your own blade slipped and I've still a mark on my rib to show for it.'Some of the ladies at court had found the scar quite appealing.Rob's frown did not ease, but he jerked his head to the guards. The gate opened, creaking.John rode in, searching for something he might recognise. Was that the corner where he and Rob had practised with dagger and sword? This the spot where he and his sister had buried their toys? It felt no more familiar than any of the succession of castles he and the king had slept in over the years.And no more welcoming.A slender young woman with flowing red hair stepped into the courtyard. 'Johnnie?' Bessie.His sister, at least, knew him. When he'd left, she had been eight and they had been the youngest together, united against the world.Now, she was a woman grown.He swung off the horse and hugged her, letting her squeeze him back, holding the embrace longer than he would have because it gave him something to do. Time to think. And a moment's illusion that he still belonged here.'Ah, Johnnie, I always told them you would come home.'He held her away so he could see her eyes. Brown, like all the Brunsons except his, but today, red with tears.He shook his head. 'Not for long, Bessie.' Never again. 'I'm Sir John now. I ride beside the king.'Rob, down from the wall, clasped his arm, without warmth.'I must talk to you,' John began. 'The king wants—' 'Whatever the king wants, I'll not hear of it now. It will wait until we've sent Red Geordie to rest with our forefolk.'It was always thus. All work, all life would stop for the 'dead days' before burial.Well, that might be the way of the Borders, but the king had no time to wait.Still, John held his tongue and followed Bessie into the tower. His heavy armour clanked in protest as they climbed the stairs to the central gathering room.'I found him in his bed,' Bessie said, as if she thought John would care, 'when he didn't come to break fast. Died in his sleep he did, with no one to receive his last words.' She whispered, as if to speak aloud would make her cry. 'Snatched away without a moment to say farewell.' Her voice shook. 'Yet peaceful he looked, like he was still asleep.''No death for a fighting man,' Rob muttered behind him.At the door to the gathering hall, Bessie paused. 'I must make his body ready.' She gave John another brief hug, then climbed the stairs to the floor beyond, where his father lay dead, hovering above him like an evil angel.She, at least, mourned Geordie Brunson.They entered a crowded hall, the yawning hearth half filling the outer wall. But instead of sorrowful mourners, he first faced a table surrounded by half a dozen warriors.'This is my brother, John,' Rob announced, with no acknowledgement of his knighthood and no hint that he might have come for any other reason than to mourn his father.One by one, the men rose to greet him. Toughened by war and hard living, wearing vests of quilted wool and boots of well-worn leather, each man took his hand, took him in, and gave him trust because he was a Brunson. No other reason given and none needed.The last one, slender shouldered, sitting with his back turned, rose last. And John saw, astonished, that he faced a woman.Her brown eyes did not meet his with the warmth of the others.'This is Cate,' Rob said. 'These men are hers.' He said the words as if it were no more remarkable than blooming heather.She was tall and spare and blonde as the brown-eyed Viking who, legend said, was the father of all Brunsons. Nose sharp, chin square, cheeks hollow with more than hunger, neither face nor body showed a woman's softness.A woman who refused to be one. How did he treat such a woman?He thrust his hand to shake hers, as he had the others, but she did not reach out, deigning only a curt nod. He returned it, his hand dropping awkwardly to his side as he suppressed his resentment. Then he broke away from her stare, his gaze falling, without deliberate intent, to search for breasts and hips. He found only edges, no curves. No comfort for a man there.And based on the expressions of the other men, none sought.'Are you a Brunson, then?' he asked. She looked like some cousin, long forgotten.She lifted her chin and gave a quick shake of her head, ruffling her cropped hair. 'I'm a Gilnock.'The Gilnock family were distant kin, descended from the same brown-eyed, bloodthirsty Norseman as the Brunsons—and the only family on the Border more unforgiving than his own.'But she's under our roof now,' Rob said. Under Brunson protection, as might happen when a child was orphaned.With a quick motion, she dismissed her men and moved closer to Rob and John.'I must speak with you, Rob,' she said. Her voice surprised John. It was lower than he expected, the words round and deep and shimmering as if she were whispering secrets in the dark. 'Your father died with his word unkept. What happens now?''He was not your father,' John retorted, wondering what had been promised. Yet she seemed more a Brunson than he, as if she had donned men's clothes in order to usurp his place.'He was my headman,' she answered, looking at the new headman when she answered. 'Sworn to protect my family.''A Brunson gave you his word,' Rob said, anger edging his words. 'It will be kept.'On the border, a man's word was good after death. At court, it might not be good after dinner.'When?' she asked.'After he's buried,' Rob answered. 'It must wait.' He looked at John, the glance a warning. 'As must other things.'Cate caught the look and turned to John. 'You do not come because of his death?' Her eyes, assessing him, seemed ready to judge his answer. Not for this woman the warmth he usually felt from her kind. She seemed as cold and fierce as his brother.Rob might want him to wait for the burial, but his father was dead and the king alive. And impatient. 'I bring a summons from the king.''You mean from his uncles or his mother or his stepfather?' Rob looked no more willing to listen than Cate Gilnock.John understood his hesitation. James, six years younger than John, had been king since birth, but he'd been under the control of others for the sixteen years since then. 'From none of those. It's his personal rule, now. No one else's.'They sat, silent, thinking of all this meant.'A man with much to prove, then,' Rob said.Did Rob speak of the king? Or himself?Cate's lips twisted in a smirk. 'So what message is so important that your bairn king would send you here, all dressed in armour, to tell us?'The harness and badge he'd been so proud to wear had impressed the beauties at court. 'He's your king, too.''Is he?' She shrugged dismissal. 'I've never met him, never sworn my allegiance. My family and my own right arm keep me safe, not your king.''But he will.' He fought the tug of her voice, a strange combination of scorn and seduction. 'He commands our men to join him in war against the traitor who has held him captive for the past two years.'The 'traitor' had once been a duly appointed regent, but all things change.Cate, not Rob, jumped in to answer. 'And the wee king sent you to tell us, did he? You might have spared your horse. Brunson men will ride for no king of Fife. They ride to fulfil the promise of Geordie the Red and put Scarred Willie Storwick dead in the ground.'He wondered what the man had done to earn such vengeance, but it mattered not. If that was his father's promise, it would be broken.'The king commands you to fight his enemies, not each other. There'll be no more raiding and reiving and thieving of cattle and sheep. I come to carry out the king's will.'And to earn his place at the king's side, but that would not sway them.'And do you also come to stop the sun from rising of a morning?' The curve at the corner of her mouth was a poor substitute for a smile.If a man had said it, John might have answered with a fist to his gab. 'The king wants—''The king doesn't rule here.' Rob's words were low and hard, his expression the one that had earned him the nickname"", ""Black. 'We"", ""do.'"", 'I', ""do, he might have said, for his brother would be the one to say where the Brunsons would ride.Yesterday, the decision would have been his father's.'Surely your loyalty does not rest with the English king?''My family holds my loyalty,' his brother said. 'Who holds yours?'He and his family had parted ways years before. Nothing had made that more clear than returning to them. 'We all owe loyalty to the throne. Scotland must be one country or it will be no country at all.''I owe nothing to your bairn king,' Cate said, heading for the door. 'Go back and tell him to leave us be.'No one followed her.John looked back at Rob, waiting for a decision, but his brother seemed frozen with grief. The son most like his father, Rob had been prepared all his life to lead the family, but uncertainty lay beneath the stubborn set of his jaw.Borderers had long held themselves above the king of either country.No, now was not the moment to force a sorrowing son to choose between his father's promise and the king's command.But if Cate released Rob from his father's promise, then the choice would be easier. John would have to wrestle only with his brother's stubbornness instead of with a dead man's ghost. No, in order for the Brunson men to ride east to meet the king, Cate Gilnock must drop her demands and step aside.So John would persuade her to do exactly that.And quickly. The king was expecting John to deliver Brunson men before the first frost.Brew was served and the sharing of stories began, stories of Geordie the Red at his best. And his worst.Refusing to share in laughter and tears he did not feel, John left Rob and the rest in the hall and went in search of a place to stow his gear and his armour.Avoiding the floor where his father's body lay, he made his way to the open sleeping room on the upper level. He had travelled alone, without even a squire, for speed and secrecy, so he wrestled his armour off by himself.He would certainly not beg his brother for help. Instead, he pondered the problem of Cate Gilnock.For the few days of the wake and burial, he would leave Rob to mourn and turn his charm on the woman. By the time his father was in the ground, he'd have her ready to release Rob from whatever promise she'd been given.She looked and sounded like no woman he had ever met, yet underneath, he had no doubt that she was the same as all the rest. With the right handling, she'd be persuaded to peace.Reason would be useless, of course. Near as useless as, he feared, it would be against his brother. But there were other ways.His family might confound him, but women did not. He knew how to flatter and cajole them, how to overcome their feigned resistance, and how to coax a smile or a kiss. He and the king had shared their fill of women and John had even taught the younger man a thing or two, though in truth, the king needed little teaching in this realm.He headed down the stairs to find her, a smile returning to his face. No doubt Cate Gilnock had never been wooed by a man before, acting as she did. All she needed was a honeyed word and a winning smile and she'd soon be releasing Rob from the daft-headed promise his father had made.And Brunson men would be riding to join their king.""]";6.89;Blythe Gifford (Author);['Books', 'Literature & Fiction', 'United States'];"{'Publisher': 'Harlequin Historical; Original edition (October 23, 2012)', 'Language': 'English', 'Mass Market Paperback': '288 pages', 'ISBN 10': '0373297149', 'ISBN 13': '978-0373297146', 'Item Weight': '4.8 ounces', 'Dimensions': '4.22 x 0.78 x 6.61 inches'}";0373297149

All rights reserved.', 'Chapter 1 The Merino Rose is sitting on my coffee table. I can see it in the lights I left blazing in the practice room, but seeing it doesn\'t make it any more believable. What\'s even more incredible is that the Merino Rose, ""the violin of angels"" is actually mine. The Brahms Violin Concerto was played for the first time on this violin. The King of Strings. And it doesn\'t even exist. The Merino Rose was destroyed in the Trieste Opera fire in 1881. Everybody knows that. If a Guarnerius with inlaid roses around the back edge shows up at auction, it\'s got to be a fake. Except? maybe not. What keeps those forgeries coming is that no one can prove that the fire destroyed the Merino Rose. No one can even prove the violin was actually in Trieste. It was Vittorio Bonacci who was there. Was the Merino Rose with him? Was he the thief who stole it from Joseph Joachim\'s Berlin conservatory. The questions don\'t matter anymore. The violin is real. It\'s been gone for more than a century, and it vanished before reliable sound Strings recording was invented. Even so, the legend of the Rose\'s unsurpassed brilliance has lived on. It defies reason, but the world still mourns the loss of a violin no one alive has ever heard. I knew this was the Rose the instant I heard that one note. Yes, I have years of experience playing and appraising stringed instruments, but that knowledge only served to corroborate what I knew the moment I plucked that string. The Merino Rose is more than a haunting memory. The world will soon find out that one of its loveliest treasures still occupies three dimensions. I can already see the cameras, the microphones, the throngs of reporters. When I say the word, they\'ll be here, each one more eager than the last to hear the edict of Edward Spencer IV. They consider me an undisputed authority, after all, an expert with unimpeachable credentials to give them the answer to the one question they\'re all dying to ask. Oh, they\'ll listen in rapt silence while I play the Brahms, and they\'ll pretend they care when I speak of the Rose\'s sweet perfection. But that\'s not what they\'re really after. All they want is a number. In the end I\'ll give them exactly that, and they\'ll go away happy, believing I have priced the priceless. They will never know what it really cost to bring the Merino Rose to my coffee table. Only Olivia knows, and she\'s not here. I discovered I was a string man when I was eight years old and attending summer camp in Idaho. The music counselor handed me a violin when I arrived, and the moment I felt the smooth wood under my fingers, I was smitten. At first, it was the construction of the thing that captivated me. I come from a manufacturing family. yes, I\'m a Spencer from the Spencer Luggage family, and I\'d spent my early years hearing about the intricacies of design and fabrication. I\'d hung around our factory in Los Angeles every day after school, and I could have constructed a suitcase single-handed by the time I\'d finished fourth grade. The violin was far finer than a valise, and its curved surfaces fascinated me. Even the bow seemed like a work of art. If you think it odd that I\'d never touched a violin until I was eight, you\'ve never met my father. Edward Spencer III thought music was fine, in its place. He\'d sung with the Yale Alley Cats when he was in college, but that was over once the sheepskin traded hands. Singing was just wholesome recreation, the same as summer camp. There was no room for it in real life. Hobbies like building models belonged there, that was practical engineering. But music? Frank Sinatra on the hi-fi while you sipped your pre-dinner Scotch, that was where music belonged. Fathers, however, have always had a hard time stifling their children\'s infatuations. I was in love with the violin from that first moment of contact, and I spent the summer making it mine. The music counselor, happy to find an avid pupil, spent hours with me, got me excused from canoeing and archery. By the end of the summer, I could play. And play I did. When my parents came to collect me on the last day of camp, I was the star of the talent show, the centerpiece of a group that included the music counselor and two of his friends who were members of the Spokane Symphony. My parents were very proud, and they seemed to listen carefully when the music counselor told them I was a ""natural talent."" ""He should have lessons,"" Mike said, and he gave them the name of a teacher in Los Angeles. My mother agreed that I should continue studying violin, and she arranged for lessons with Howard Stiles, who had just retired as concertmaster with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Mr. Stiles wasn\'t the name my counselor had suggested. My mother moved in Los Angeles social stratosphere, and if her son was going to study violin, the teacher would have to be Someone.', 'Read more']";13.0;Megan Edwards (Author);"['Books', 'Literature & Fiction', ""Women's Fiction""]";{'Publisher': 'Imbrifex Books (September 11, 2017)', 'Language': 'English', 'Paperback': '210 pages', 'ISBN 10': '1945501030', 'ISBN 13': '978-1945501036', 'Reading age': '15 years and up', 'Item Weight': '9.6 ounces', 'Dimensions': '5.5 x 0.5 x 8.5 inches'};1945501030

Handsome Women;"['From Publishers Weekly', 'Women absorbed in the armed forces, in this case two sisters whose lives are shaped by the evolving careers of their husbands, provide the subject of this uneven novel. Born into a military family, Louise and Marynell dream of West Point weddings. Louise, serious and naive, lands the best catch at the Point, marries early and spends years in wifely devotion and sexual subjugation to her rising-star husband, who eventually becomes a general and superintendent of the Point. For the beautiful Marynell, the dream of a crossed-sabres wedding does not materialize. Although she marries an officer, he is a widower whose ambitions, she is disconcerted to discover, lie outside the military. Wall ( Love and Duty ) follows the sisters through the dislocations of military postings, wartime separations that force them into constrained existences, to their children and their friends, many of whom are involved in anti-Vietnam causes.

Sometimes the publishers call. When he gets on the phone, he sweats; afterwards the right side of his face is damp. I like to monitor these subtle changes. Last night my father found us touching legs. ‘Go to your room!’ he shouted. ‘You shabby daughter.’ ‘You worthless excuse for a story,’ the biographer added. They played cards to settle a debt. That day my mouth felt wetter than usual. I asked the biographer to check.

Nobodies, The;"['From School Library Journal', 'Grade 5-8- This sequel to', 'The Anybodies', '(HarperCollins, 2004) is written in the same vein, with strange talking animals and weird goings-on. The prologue features the ""author,"" N. E. Bode, addressing readers in a distinctly Lemony Snicket-esque tone, even to the extent of repeatedly mentioning attempts on his life due to his knowledge of the events in the two books. Fern briefly summarizes events from the first book, but those who have not read it will still be somewhat confused. Fern is an Anybody, who can transform objects into reality. Her grandmother lives in a house made of books and populated by characters that have fallen out of the pages of these volumes. Howard and Fern, both 11 and uneasily starting a friendship, are to spend the summer at an Anybodies camp called Camp Happy Sunshine Good Times. Of course, a camp with that moniker is bound to be anything but fun. Its administrators seem quite sinister, and include an extremely unpleasant and evil mole. The counselors are obnoxious to the kids during the day but at night are trapped in animal form and try to protect the children from frightening and mysterious events. Will the evil Mole successfully steal Fern\'s precious book,', 'The Art of Being Anybody', ', thereby giving him access to all the secrets therein? And what is the significance of the fizzy drinks that the counselors incessantly drink? The book ends somewhat abruptly, with all questions answered.

Magi'i of Cyador (Saga of Recluce);"['From Publishers Weekly', ""Once again Modesitt (Colors of Chaos, The Spellsong Cycle series) returns to the fantasy world of his popular Saga of Recluce series, now with the first book in a new story line set in Recluce's past. The only thing standing between the Empire of Cyador and destruction is the power of the Magi'i, who wield the energies of chaos to defend the land against invading barbarians and the ancient dark forces of the Accursed Forest. Lorn, the son of a high-ranking Magi'i, finds the magical order's many rules too constricting and is sent off to join the Lancers and fight Cyador's countless enemies on the borderlands. That distance doesn't remove him from the constant intrigues and power struggles back home in Cyan, however. While Lorn battles to survive barbarian raids and attacks from the Accursed Forest's worst nightmares, his lover, the merchant Ryalth, works to build her business despite threats from unscrupulous rivals. Though Lorn survives and, by the end of the book, manages to take Ryalth as his consort, it's clear that Modesitt has much more in store for his characters. True to form, the author delivers a complex plot wrapped around finely textured settings and intriguing characters. Fans of previous Recluce novels will find this new series darker in tone--and Lorn is quite a bit more ruthless than the usual Modesitt hero--but they won't be disappointed. Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc."", 'From Library Journal', 'Judged lacking in the loyalty and dedication necessary for a position as one of the elite mages of Cyador, Lorn receives an assignment to the Mirror Lancers who protect the land of Cyador from the barbarian frontier--a tour of duty that often results in an early death. The latest in Modesitt\'s popular ""Recluce"" series begins a new cycle in the history of a world based upon the delicate balance of chaos and order. The author\'s talent for combining large-scale action with the minutiae of his characters\' daily lives infuses his story with a veracity often lacking in the genre. A good choice for most fantasy collections, particularly where the series is popular. Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.', 'From', 'Booklist', ""Modesitt begins another new saga, a spin-off from his best-selling and magisterial Recluce series. The setting is the empire of Cyador, and the protagonist is Lorn, a talented youth from a magus family who is diligent in his studies but too independent-minded to suit the High Magi'i. So he is commissioned an officer of lancers and sent to fight barbarians on the frontier, which is by no means a sinecure. Much of the rest of the novel is taken up with scene setting; developing Lorn as officer, magus, and lover; introducing people and places in Cyador; and hinting at some of the high-level intrigue going on behind the curtains, so to speak. The ending reeks strongly of cliffhanger, and still the book stands up well enough on its own, especially for readers coming to it from the Recluce saga--a numerous band. Fantasy collections, take note."", 'Roland Green', 'From Kirkus Reviews', ""Tenth installment of Modesitt's huge Saga of Recluce fantasy (Colors of Chaos, 1999, etc.). Recluce is an admittedly superior potboiler series with an exceptionally well worked-out magical backdrop. Its popularity, however (and that of other, similarly endless series), provokes a more general question: do the fans really prefer endless small variations on a single doorstopper theme?

I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets;"['From Publishers Weekly', 'The stay-at-home dad isn\'t such an anomaly these days-newspapers run popular-trend features about him, and he himself might write a book about the job (e.g. David Eddie\'s Housebroken) but the world may have never encountered such a superfather as Stockler seems to be in this parenting memoir. Already an experienced dad-though not an official stay-at-homer, he\'s the primary caretaker of his two-year-old son Asher (his wife, Roni, is a high-powered New York lawyer)-Stockler nevertheless faces a new and daunting level of responsibility when Roni becomes pregnant with triplets. With keen wit (Stockler has worked as a jokewriter for Jay Leno and writes a humor column for Esquire), he chronicles the difficult pregnancy, offers a dramatic and moving description of the babies\' birth, and describes escapade after sleepless escapade with three growing newborns and a toddler. Parents will laugh out loud during the ""Lost in the Supermarket"" chapter, in which Stockler must strategically position his wagonful of children so that it\'s far from the bagel display without being close to the muffins-""I made that mistake once and muffins flew through the air like antiaircraft fire""-as well as try to keep one triplet from licking raw chicken juice, another from launching herself from the wagon, and another from freaking out over breakfast cereal. (Asher, four by this time, charms throughout.) They will also appreciate the sometimes startling honesty with which he describes family relationships and the challenges of parenting. Nevertheless, some will wish the book had a wider scope-it gains depth when it considers larger contexts, like the prejudice Roni faces as a working mother when the family moves to the suburbs, but it does this only rarely and briefly. Also, it suffers from some poor editing-the structure is somewhat loose and repetitions abound. But these flaws ultimately don\'t detract from this book\'s overall appeal, which should extend even to those fathers who have just one newborn to contend with. Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.', 'From', 'Booklist', ""If you've ever wondered what it might be like to have your family suddenly doubled in size, check out this extremely funny, extremely perceptive memoir by the author of"", 'Esquire', '\'s bimonthly ""Crazy Talk"" column. Already the parents of a three-year-old boy, Stockler and his wife find themselves expecting triplets, and nothing will ever seem quite the same again. The author documents the experience from the get-go (the joyful yet surreal news that they\'re going to have three little babies), through the months leading up to the birth, and on to the first precious years of the triplets\' lives. The book is charming and tender, with moments of outright hilarity (the author is, after all, a humor writer). Stockler\'s voice is fresh and memorable: it\'s hard to forget his description of him and his wife, learning of the pregnancy, as confused as ""dogs dropped onto the surface of a strange and dogless planet,"" or as numb and soft as ""frozen sticks of butter defrosting.""
